# Wyner–Ziv operational achievability (binning + covering)

This file assembles the operational achievability leg of the Wyner–Ziv theorem
(Cover–Thomas Theorem 15.9.1): a rate `R` above the information-theoretic rate
`wynerZivRate` is achievable at distortion `D` for the i.i.d. source `P_XY` with
decoder side information `Y`.

## Approach

Wyner–Ziv achievability is a two-layer hybrid: **rate-distortion covering** on the
`X → U` side and **Slepian–Wolf binning** on the side-information `Y` side.

* the encoder covers `X^n` by a codeword `U^n` drawn from an i.i.d. codebook
  (rate-distortion covering, `jointTypicalLossyEncoder`), then bins the codeword
  index (Slepian–Wolf binning, `binningMeasure`) down to rate `R ≈ I(X;U) −
  I(Y;U)`;
* the decoder receives `(bin index, Y^n)` and searches its bin for the unique
  codeword conditionally typical with `Y^n`.

The two error mechanisms decouple cleanly (see the *gateway atoms* below), each
living on its own conditional-typicality slice under the **common** alphabet
assignment "covering codeword `U` in the source role, side information `Y` as the
conditioning variable":

* **decoder confusion** — a wrong binned codeword `U'^n` shares the true bin and
  is conditionally typical with `Y^n`. Its expected mass over the random binning
  is bounded by (slice cardinality) `/` (bin count), via the Slepian–Wolf alias
  bound `swError_EX_expectation_le` (itself `binning_collision_prob` ∘
  `conditionalTypicalSlice_card_le`). This is the `Y`-fixed, `U`-counted slice.
* **covering acceptance** — the true covering codeword is itself conditionally
  typical with `Y^n` (not rejected), via the strong conditional-slice mass bound
  `conditionalStronglyTypicalSlice_mass_ge`. This is the `U`-fixed, `Y`-measured
  slice.

These are transposed fibers of the same joint typicality relation, but they never
need to be reconciled into one statement: they bound *independent* error events.
The apparent transposition between the strong slice (`conditionalStronglyTypical`,
`U`-fixed) and the weak slice (`conditionalTypical`, `Y`-fixed) is therefore not
an obstruction — it is exactly the decomposition the error analysis wants.

## Main statements

* `wyner_ziv_achievability` — the operational achievability headline.

## Gateway atoms (both reuse existing, proved in-project atoms)

* `wz_sideInfo_decoder_confusion_expectation_le` — the decoder-confusion bound,
  by instantiating the Slepian–Wolf alias bound with the covering codeword in the
  source role.
* `wz_covering_sideInfo_mass_ge` — the covering-acceptance mass bound, by
  instantiating the strong conditional-slice mass bound with the same alphabet
  assignment.

## Implementation notes

The remaining work is pure plumbing: threading these two exponents through the
Wyner–Ziv error decomposition, splitting the rate as `R = I(X;U) − I(Y;U)`, and
extracting a good codebook by the pigeonhole averaging `exists_codebook_low_avg`.
The headline body is deferred to a follow-up leg and marked
`@residual(plan:wyner-ziv-main-plan)`.

/-! ## Gateway atom 1 — side-information decoder confusion bound

Instantiation of the Slepian–Wolf alias bound `swError_EX_expectation_le` with the
covering codeword `U` in the source (`α`) role and the side information `Y` in the
`β` role. The bound is `exp(n · (H(U,Y) − H(Y) + 2ε)) / M = exp(n · (H(U|Y) + 2ε))
/ M`, the confusable-codeword count divided by the bin count. -/

/-- **Wyner–Ziv side-information decoder confusion bound.** For a random binning
`f` of the covering-codeword space `Fin n → U` into `M` bins, the expected
`μ`-probability (over the binning `f ∼ binningMeasure U n M`) that some codeword
`u' ≠ U^n` that is jointly typical with the received side information `Y^n` hashes
to the same bin as the true codeword `U^n` is at most `exp(n · (H(U|Y) + 2ε)) / M`.

This is the decoder-confusion half of Wyner–Ziv achievability. It is the
side-information analogue of the Slepian–Wolf alias bound, with the covering
codeword `U` in the source role and the side information `Y` as the conditioning
variable; the proof is a direct instantiation of `swError_EX_expectation_le`,
witnessing that the binning ∘ conditional-typicality composition closes as
plumbing over an existing atom.

/-! ## Gateway atom 2 — covering acceptance mass bound

Instantiation of the strong conditional-slice mass bound
`conditionalStronglyTypicalSlice_mass_ge` with the same alphabet assignment. For a
strongly-typical covering codeword `u`, the product `Y`-mass of the fiber of side
words jointly (strongly) typical with `u` is at least `exp(−n · (I(U;Y) + slack))`.
This ensures the true covering codeword is not rejected by the side-information
decoder. -/

/-- **Wyner–Ziv covering acceptance mass bound.** For a strongly-typical covering
codeword `u : Fin n → U`, the product `Y`-mass of the fiber of side words jointly
strongly typical with `u` is bounded below by `exp(−n · (H(U) + H(Y) − H(U,Y) +
slack))`, i.e. `exp(−n · (I(U;Y) + slack))`. This is the covering-acceptance half
of Wyner–Ziv achievability: the correct covering codeword is conditionally typical
with the side information with high probability. Direct instantiation of
`conditionalStronglyTypicalSlice_mass_ge`.

/-! ## Rate non-negativity leaf (data-processing)

The reshaped Wyner–Ziv rate is non-negative: every factorisable feasible objective
`I(X;U) − I(Y;U)` is `≥ 0` by the data-processing inequality for the Markov chain
`U − X − Y` (`wzObjective_nonneg_of_factorizable`), so its infimum over the
non-degenerate value set is `≥ 0`. Combined with `h_rate`, this pins `0 < R`, which
is exactly what the codebook-rate tendsto `codebookSize_log_div_tendsto` needs. -/

a feasible factorisable point forces `k > 0` because a `Fin 0` kernel has row-sum
`∑_{u:Fin 0} κ x u = 0 ≠ 1`. TRUE-as-framed even in the empty-feasible-set regime

/-! ## Covering + binning construction (hard leg)

The centrepiece of Wyner–Ziv achievability: from a feasible test channel below the
rate `R`, build a sequence of Wyner–Ziv block codes with `codebookSize R n =
⌈exp(n R)⌉` messages whose expected block distortion is eventually within `D + ε`.

The construction is the two-layer hybrid (rate-distortion covering on the `X → U`
side, Slepian–Wolf binning on the side-information `Y` side) whose two error
mechanisms are the gateway atoms `wz_sideInfo_decoder_confusion_expectation_le`
and `wz_covering_sideInfo_mass_ge`, with a good codebook extracted by the
pigeonhole averaging `exists_codebook_low_avg`. Deferred as the remaining plumbing
body of this plan. -/

/-- **Witness extraction (Step 0).** From the feasibility guard `h_ne` and the
rate strict inequality `h_rate`, extract a concrete finite auxiliary alphabet
`Fin k`, a factorisable test channel `qf` feasible at distortion `D`, whose
Wyner–Ziv objective `I(X;U) − I(Y;U)` is strictly below `R`.

This is `exists_lt_of_csInf_lt` on the infimum-of-values definition of
`wynerZivRate` (`= sInf (wzRateValueSet …)`), with the resulting value unpacked
by `mem_wzRateValueSet_iff` into a feasible factorisable point.

with objective `< R` — no vacuous/`sInf ∅` shortcut.) -/

/-- **Covering + binning construction (Steps 1–5, the hard leg).** From a
feasible factorisable test channel `qf` at auxiliary alphabet `Fin k` whose
Wyner–Ziv objective `I(X;U) − I(Y;U)` is strictly below `R`, build a sequence of
Wyner–Ziv block codes at the operational message rate `R` (`codebookSize R n =
⌈exp(n R)⌉` messages) whose expected block distortion is eventually within
`D + ε` for every `ε > 0`.

The construction is the two-layer hybrid: rate-distortion covering `X → U`
(`jointTypicalLossyEncoder` over the codebook alphabet `U = Fin k`) fused with
Slepian–Wolf binning of the covering index (`binningMeasure`), decoded by a
conditional-typicality slice search (`conditionalTypicalSlice`). The three error
exponents — covering failure (E1, `encoder_failure_prob_le_exp_neg_M_avg`),
decoder confusion (E2, `wz_sideInfo_decoder_confusion_expectation_le`) and
covering acceptance (E3, `wz_covering_sideInfo_mass_ge`) — are threaded through
the rate split `R = I(X;U) − I(Y;U)`, with a good deterministic codebook
extracted by the pigeonhole averaging `exists_codebook_low_avg` and the residual
distortion excess squeezed to `0` by `ceil_exp_mul_exp_neg_tendsto_atTop`.

The test channel `qf` is a feasibility/regularity hypothesis (a single-letter
pmf feasible at `D`, objective below `R`), NOT the load-bearing covering+binning
core; the whole construction stays in the `sorry` body.

/-- Existence of a Wyner–Ziv code sequence (at the operational message rate `R`)
whose expected block distortion is eventually within `D + ε`.

The body is now a genuine reduction (sorry-free itself): `wz_testChannel_of_rate_lt`
extracts a feasible factorisable test channel below `R` from the feasibility guard
`h_ne` and `h_rate`, and `wz_goodCode_exists_of_testChannel` builds the code
sequence from it. `sorryAx` enters only via that construction lemma, whose covering
+ binning body is the remaining plumbing.

The feasibility precondition `h_ne` (the rate-distortion value set is nonempty at
`D`) makes the signature well-posed: it rules out the infeasible regime `D` below
the min achievable distortion (e.g. any `D < 0` for a `NNReal` distortion), where
`wzRateValueSet` is empty and `wynerZivRate = sInf ∅ = 0` would otherwise let
`h_rate : 0 < R` coexist with a FALSE existence claim. `h_ne` is a
regularity/feasibility precondition, NOT the load-bearing covering+binning core
(which stays in the construction lemma's `sorry` body); the converse side already
threads exactly this guard (`wynerZivRate_antitone`, `Converse.lean:2602`).

/-- **Wyner–Ziv operational achievability.** If the information-theoretic
Wyner–Ziv rate `wynerZivRate` at distortion `D` for the i.i.d. source `P_XY` (with
decoder side information `Y`) is strictly below `R`, then `R` is operationally
achievable at distortion `D`: there is a sequence of Wyner–Ziv block codes whose
log-cardinality rate tends to `R` and whose expected block distortion is
eventually within `D + ε` for every `ε > 0`.

The body is assembled: the message sequence is fixed to `codebookSize R n =
⌈exp(n R)⌉`, whose log-cardinality rate tends to `R` via `codebookSize_log_div_tendsto`
(using `0 < R`, from `wynerZivRate_nonneg` and `h_rate`); the distortion sequence is
supplied by the covering + binning construction `wyner_ziv_achievability_codes`,
which carries the remaining plumbing `sorry`. The headline itself is `sorry`-free
(it reduces to that one residual lemma).

The signature carries the same feasibility precondition `h_ne` as the codes lemma,
so it is well-posed: the body is a genuine reduction (sorry-free itself, `sorryAx`

# The time-and-band-limiting operator on `L²(ℝ;ℂ)`

Cover–Thomas Ch. 9.6 (Shannon–Hartley), Phase 2 spectral leg A. This file builds the
self-adjoint positive contraction

    `A = P_W ∘ Q_T ∘ P_W`

on the complex Hilbert space `E = L²(ℝ;ℂ)`, where `Q_T` is the orthogonal projection onto the
time-limited subspace (functions a.e.-supported in `[0,T]`) and `P_W` the projection onto the
band-limited subspace (functions whose L²-Fourier transform is a.e.-supported in `[-W,W]`). Both
projections are `Submodule.starProjection`s onto genuinely closed subspaces, so `A`'s
self-adjointness and positivity are one-line consequences of the projection API.

## Main statements

* `timeLimitSubspace` / `bandLimitSubspace` — the two closed subspaces.
* `timeBandLimitingOp` — the operator `A = P_W ∘ Q_T ∘ P_W`.
* `timeBandLimitingOp_isSelfAdjoint` — `A` is self-adjoint.
* `timeBandLimitingOp_isPositive` — `A` is a positive operator.
* `timeBandLimitingOp_norm_le_one` — `‖A‖ ≤ 1` (contraction).

Leg B adds compactness `timeBandLimitingOp_isCompact`, reducing it — via `A = P_W ∘ C` with
`C = Q_T ∘ P_W` — to compactness of the sinc integral operator `C`, whose Hilbert–Schmidt kernel is
`sincConvKernel t s = 𝟙_[0,T](t) · 2W · sincN(2W(t−s))`.

Leg C adds the decreasing eigenvalue enumeration. Mathlib's ordered `ℕ → ℝ` eigenvalue sequence is
`FiniteDimensional`-gated, so it is rebuilt here from the structural compact self-adjoint spectral
theorem: `prolateEigenvalueSet_finite` (only finitely many eigenvalues exceed any `c > 0`) makes the
counting function `prolateCount` honest, and `prolateEigenvalues` is its generalized inverse.

* `prolateEigenvalueSet_finite` — finitely many eigenvalues above any positive threshold.
* `prolateEigenvalues` — the eigenvalues of `A` in decreasing order, listed with multiplicity.
* `prolateEigenvalues_antitone` / `_nonneg` / `_le_one` — the enumeration decreases within `[0,1]`.
* `prolateEigenvalues_hasEigenvalue` — every nonzero entry is a genuine eigenvalue of `A`.
* `prolateEigenvalues_tendsto_zero` — the enumeration tends to `0`.

Leg C' makes that enumeration non-vacuous. The headlines above are all satisfied by the constant-zero
sequence — and legitimately so, since `A` really does collapse for `W ≤ 0` or `T ≤ 0`. The single
missing input is `timeBandLimitingOp_ne_zero`, proved by exhibiting the box `𝟙_[0,T]` as a witness:
its spectrum is continuous with value `T` at the origin (via the `L¹ ∩ L²` Fourier bridge
`ShannonHartley.l2Fourier_eq_fourierIntegral`), hence survives the band cutoff since `[-W,W]` is a
neighborhood of `0`.

* `timeBandLimitingOp_ne_zero` — `A ≠ 0` for `0 < T`, `0 < W`.
* `prolateEigenvalues_zero_pos` — the leading eigenvalue is strictly positive.

Both of its hypotheses are tight, and the boundary lemmas witnessing that are in-tree rather than
prose: the two subspaces collapse to `⊥` for a nonpositive parameter
(`timeLimitSubspace_eq_bot_of_nonpos` / `bandLimitSubspace_eq_bot_of_nonpos`), hence so does `A`,
hence the enumeration is identically `0` there (`prolateEigenvalues_eq_zero_of_time_nonpos` /
`prolateEigenvalues_eq_zero_of_band_nonpos`). The degeneracy story is told once, at the section
header preceding `zeroOnLp_eq_bot_of_ae_mem`.

Leg E adds the `2WT` degrees-of-freedom bound, in the Bessel form the Hilbert-space structure
supports directly. `P_W` is the integral operator against the reproducing kernel
`k_t = 2W sincN(2W(t − ·))`, so `(P_W f)(t) = ⟪k_t, f⟫` and `⟪A f, f⟫ = ∫_[0,T] |⟪k_t, f⟫|² dt`.
Bessel's inequality applied under that integral, against the constant kernel norm `‖k_t‖² = 2W`,
caps the trace of `A` along any finite orthonormal family; Markov converts this into the counting
bound. Only a *finite* orthonormal family is involved, so no trace-class or Schatten theory (absent
from Mathlib) is needed.

* `bandKernelLp` — the reproducing kernel `k_t`, with `bandKernelLp_norm_sq : ‖k_t‖² = 2W`.
* `bandLimitProj_apply_eq_inner` — the reproducing property `(P_W f)(t) = ⟪k_t, f⟫`.
* `inner_timeBandLimitingOp_self_eq` — `⟪A f, f⟫` is the energy of `P_W f` on the window `[0,T]`.
* `sum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le` — `∑ᵢ ⟪A eᵢ, eᵢ⟫ ≤ 2WT` for orthonormal `e`.
* `prolateCount_mul_le` — `c · #{λ > c} ≤ 2WT`.

Both hypotheses of the last two are tight in the same way as above: for `T < 0` or `W < 0` the
operator collapses, so the trace is `0` while the claimed bound `2WT` is strictly negative.

Leg E-trace upgrades that Bessel *inequality* to a Parseval *equality*: along a *complete* basis the
trace is exactly `2WT`. The mechanism needs neither the spectral theorem nor trace-class theory —
the terms are nonnegative, so Tonelli exchanges `∑'` with `∫` unconditionally, and completeness
replaces Bessel by Parseval.

* `orthonormal_countable` — an orthonormal family in a separable space is countable (absent from
  Mathlib; it discharges the Tonelli step's countability rather than assuming it).
* `tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq` — `∑'ᵢ ⟪A bᵢ, bᵢ⟫ = 2WT` for any `HilbertBasis`.
* `exists_hilbertBasis_tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq` — an in-tree non-vacuity witness.

The sharp Landau–Pollak–Slepian concentration (`⌊2WT⌋ + O(log WT)` eigenvalues near `1`, i.e. the
matching lower bound and the transition width) is still not proved here, and the exact first moment
does not bring it closer: Markov uses only the `≤` half, while a lower bound on the count needs the
*second* moment `∑ λₙ(1 − λₙ) = tr A − tr A²` to control the tail `∑_{λₙ ≤ c} λₙ`. Also still open
is `λ n ≠ 0` for all `n` (which needs `A` to have infinite rank).

Leg R1 adds the spectral gap below `c`: on the orthogonal complement of the span of the eigenspaces
above `c`, the Rayleigh quotient of `A` is at most `c`. Notably this needs no eigenbasis. `Vᗮ` is
`A`-invariant by symmetry, so `A` restricts there to a compact self-adjoint `S` whose eigenvalues
all lie in `[0, c]`; for such an operator the norm *is* the spectral radius, so `‖S‖ ≤ c` and
Cauchy-Schwarz finishes. The complete orthonormal eigenbasis that
`ContinuousLinearMap.orthogonalComplement_iSup_eigenspaces_eq_bot` would supply is therefore *not*
consumed here, and remains open at `tsum_prolateEigenvalues_eq`.

* `prolateEigenspaceSup_orthogonal_invariant` — `Vᗮ` is `A`-invariant.
* `prolateRestrict` — `A` restricted to `Vᗮ`, with `prolateRestrict_norm_le : ‖S‖ ≤ c`.
* `inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le_of_mem_orthogonal` — `⟪A v, v⟫ ≤ c‖v‖²` for `v ∈ Vᗮ`.
* `le_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_of_mem` — the matched lower bound `c‖v‖² ≤ ⟪A v, v⟫` on `V`.
* `finrank_le_prolateCount_of_form_gt` — converse min-max count domination: any `S` with Rayleigh
  quotient `> c` has `finrank S ≤ prolateCount T W c`.

Unlike the trace bounds above, this one is unconditional in `T` and `W`: `A` is compact, symmetric
and positive for every parameter value, and the bound stays true where `A` collapses to `0`.

Leg R2 assembles those into the two-sided eigenvalue count concentration, with `D := 2 + log(1+2WT)`
and the threshold `c` free (not fixed at `1/2` — the converse needs `c → 0`, the achievability
`c → 1`):

* `prolateCount_le` — `#{λ > c} ≤ 2WT + D/c` for `0 < c`.
* `le_prolateCount` — `2WT − D/(1−c) ≤ #{λ > c}` for `0 < c < 1`.

Both run through `exists_hilbertBasis_prolateSplit`, a Hilbert basis adapted to `E = V ⊕ Vᗮ` whose
`V` half is an eigenbasis (finite-dimensional spectral theorem,
`exists_orthonormal_eigenbasis_prolateEigenspaceSup`) and whose `Vᗮ` half is an arbitrary Hilbert
basis. No complete eigenbasis of `A` is ever constructed, and the count needs no multiplicity
bridge: `prolateCount` *is* the `finrank` of `V`, so the `V` half is indexed by
`Fin (prolateCount T W c)` definitionally.

## Compactness (Leg B)

Compactness of `A = P_W ∘ Q_T ∘ P_W` is reduced to compactness of the *sinc integral operator*
`C = Q_T ∘ P_W`. Since `A = P_W ∘ C` (the definition, reassociated) and `P_W` is bounded,
`A` is compact as soon as `C` is (`IsCompactOperator.clm_comp`). The operator `C` is
Hilbert–Schmidt: its integral kernel

    `sincConvKernel T W t s = 𝟙_[0,T](t) · 2W · sincN(2W(t − s))`

lies in `L²(ℝ × ℝ)` (the `t`-indicator confines the mass to `[0,T]`, and Plancherel of the ideal
low-pass gives `∫_ℝ (2W sincN(2W u))² du = 2W`, so `‖k‖₂² = 2WT < ∞`), and an `L²` kernel yields a
compact operator because the kernels with compact operator form a closed submodule containing the
rectangle indicators, which generate `L²(ℝ × ℝ)`. The genuinely analytic content lives in four
leaves:

* `timeLimitProj_apply_ae` — `Q_T` acts as multiplication by `𝟙_[0,T]` (proven, as the instance
  `S = [0,T]ᶜ` of `zeroOnLp_starProjection_apply_ae`);
* `bandLimitProj_apply_ae` — `P_W` acts as convolution with `2W sincN(2W·)` (the
  abstract-projection ↔ concrete-sinc bridge, proven). Its abstract half is
  `fourier_bandLimitProj_apply_ae`, which identifies `P_W` as the Fourier multiplier by `𝟙_[-W,W]`
  via `starProjection_comap_linearIsometryEquiv` (the `comap` form of Mathlib's
  `LinearIsometry.map_starProjection`); the concrete evaluation of `𝓕⁻¹` then goes through the
  `L¹ ∩ L²` Fourier agreement bridge `ShannonHartley.l2FourierInv_eq_fourierIntegralInv`, applied to
  the spectral cutoff `bandLimitSpec W f = 𝟙_[-W,W]·𝓕f` (integrable because the band is bounded);
* `sincConvKernel_memLp` — the kernel is `L²` on `ℝ × ℝ` (proven);
* `l2KernelOperator_isCompact` — a generic `L²`-kernel operator is compact (proven; the reusable
  Hilbert–Schmidt build, `l2KernelOp` and friends).

The remaining declarations (`timeBandLimitingComp_apply_ae`,
`timeBandLimitingComp_isCompact`, `timeBandLimitingOp_isCompact`) are genuine reductions that
compose the four leaves, so the headline `timeBandLimitingOp_isCompact` is unconditional.

Note the sign asymmetry: the kernel representation needs `0 ≤ W` (`sincN` is even, so a negative `W`
flips the sign of the kernel while `P_W` collapses to `0`), but the compactness headlines hold for
every real `W`, the degenerate band being handled separately via
`bandLimitSubspace_eq_bot_of_nonpos`.
-/

/-- The Hilbert–Schmidt kernel of the sinc integral operator `C = Q_T ∘ P_W`:
`𝟙_[0,T](t) · 2W · sincN(2W(t − s))`. The `t`-indicator encodes the time-limiting `Q_T`; the
`2W sincN(2W·)` factor is the ideal low-pass whose Fourier transform is `𝟙_[-W,W]`, i.e. the
convolution kernel of the band-limiting `P_W`. -/

`Q_T`) and Leaf 2's frequency-side multiplier (`S = {|ξ| > W}`, giving `𝟙_[-W,W]·𝓕f`) are instances,
so the projection-uniqueness argument is written once here.

entirely inside the abstract projection API; the remaining half is the identification of the

concretely. Note this half needs no sign condition on `W`: for `W < 0` the interval `[-W,W]` is

/-! ### Degeneracy at the parameter boundary

**The one place the degeneracy story is told.** Both subspaces collapse to `⊥` as soon as their
parameter is nonpositive, and for structurally identical reasons: the set on which the `L²`
functions are required to vanish becomes co-null — all of `ℝ` for a strictly negative parameter,
the complement of the null set `{0}` at the boundary itself — and an `L²` function vanishing a.e.
on a co-null set is `0`. This is a true degeneracy of the geometry (the band `[-W,W]` is empty or
null, the window `[0,T]` likewise), not an artifact of the definitions, and it is what lets the
compactness headlines below keep their unrestricted `(T W : ℝ)` signatures.

The operator- and eigenvalue-level consequences are collected in `section Degeneracy` at the end of
the file: `A = 0` on either boundary, hence `prolateEigenvalues` is identically `0` there. Those are
what make the `0 < T` and `0 < W` hypotheses of `prolateEigenvalues_zero_pos` tight.

/-- **Leaf 2** (`P_W` = convolution with `2W sincN(2W·)`). The orthogonal projection onto the
band-limited subspace acts, a.e., as convolution with the ideal low-pass `2W sincN(2W·)` (whose
Fourier transform is `𝟙_[-W,W]`). This is the abstract `starProjection`-of-a-`comap`-under-`𝓕` ↔
concrete sinc-convolution identity, and it is what turns the operator `C = Q_T ∘ P_W` into an
integral operator with the Hilbert–Schmidt kernel `sincConvKernel`.

The sign precondition `0 ≤ W` is necessary, not cosmetic: `sincN` is even, so for `W < 0` the stated
kernel `2W sincN(2W·)` is *minus* the ideal low-pass at `|W|`, while the left-hand side collapses to
`0` (`bandLimitSubspace_eq_bot_of_nonpos`). Concretely at `W = -1`, `f = 𝟙_[0,1]`, `t = 1/2` the
right-hand side is `-∫_(-1)^(1) sincN ≈ -1.179 ≠ 0`, so the unrestricted statement is false; `0 ≤ W`
is a precondition on the parameter, not a hypothesis carrying the proof.

The proof factors through the spectral cutoff `bandLimitSpec W f = 𝟙_[-W,W]·𝓕f`: the abstract half
`fourier_bandLimitProj_apply_ae` identifies `𝓕(P_W f)` with it, and since it is supported in a
bounded interval it lies in `L¹ ∩ L²`, so the Fourier bridge
`ShannonHartley.l2FourierInv_eq_fourierIntegralInv` evaluates `P_W f = 𝓕⁻¹(bandLimitSpec W f)`
pointwise as an honest integral (`bandLimitProj_coeFn_ae_eq_fourierInv`). That integral is then
identified with the sinc convolution by Plancherel against the spectral boxcar, whose inverse
transform is already known to be a shifted sinc (`ShannonHartley.fourier_shiftSinc_toLp`).
The degenerate `W = 0` band is a null set, where both sides vanish.

/-- **Leaf 3** (the kernel is `L²`). `sincConvKernel` is square-integrable on `ℝ × ℝ`: the
`t`-indicator confines the mass to `[0,T]` and the inner mass `∫_ℝ (2W sincN(2W(t−s)))² ds` is a
finite constant `C` (independent of `t`, by translation invariance of Lebesgue measure), so
`‖k‖₂² ≤ C · vol[0,T] < ∞`. The finite `L²` mass of the ideal low-pass `2W sincN(2W·)` is obtained by
rescaling the 1-D crux `sincN ∈ L²` (`sincN_memLp_two`) through `integrable_comp_mul_left_iff`, and
the 2-D lift is a Tonelli (`lintegral_prod_le`) + `lintegral_sub_left_eq_self` computation.
Hypothesis-free in `T` and `W`: the degenerate `T < 0` (empty `[0,T]`, zero mass) and `2W = 0`
(zero kernel) cases are both genuinely covered.

### The Hilbert–Schmidt machinery (Leaf 4)

Mathlib has no Hilbert–Schmidt / Schatten API, so the "`L²` kernel ⟹ compact operator" implication
is built here from scratch. The construction is deliberately reusable: `l2KernelOp` is the
*continuous linear* map sending a kernel `κ ∈ L²(ℝ × ℝ)` to the integral operator it induces on
`L²(ℝ)`, with the Hilbert–Schmidt bound `‖l2KernelOp κ‖ ≤ ‖κ‖` built into its construction.

Compactness then follows from a soft argument: `{κ | IsCompactOperator (l2KernelOp κ)}` is a
*closed submodule* of `L²(ℝ × ℝ)` (closed because `l2KernelOp` is continuous and the compact
operators are closed in the operator norm), it contains every rectangle indicator `𝟙_{A×B}` (those
induce rank-one operators), and rectangles generate the product σ-algebra — so a π-λ induction plus
`Lp.induction` push membership to the whole space.

/-- **Leaf 4** (generic `L²`-kernel ⟹ compact operator). An integral operator on `L²(ℝ;ℂ)` whose
kernel is `L²` on `ℝ × ℝ` is a compact operator; it is realized a.e. as `f ↦ ∫ k(·,s) f(s) ds`.
Built via the reusable `l2KernelOp` Hilbert–Schmidt machinery above (Mathlib has no Hilbert–Schmidt
API). Stated existentially so the operator object is genuinely constructed together with its
compactness rather than assumed; the a.e.-representation clause pins `Op` uniquely (an `Lp` element
is an a.e. class), so the existential is not weakened by it.

Only meaningful for `0 < c`, where `prolateEigenspaceSup_finiteDimensional` makes the `finrank` a
genuine dimension. For `c ≤ 0` it is a junk value: `prolateEigenspaceSup_finiteDimensional` no
longer applies, and on an infinite-dimensional span `finrank` reports `0`. This is why
`prolateEigenvalues` below takes the infimum over `0 < c` rather than `0 ≤ c` — the latter would
risk letting a junk `0` into the constraint set and collapsing the whole enumeration to `≡ 0`.
The span's infinite-dimensionality at `c ≤ 0` is expected but *not* established in-tree (at `c = 0`
it is exactly the open infinite-rank obligation noted on `prolateEigenvalues`); nothing depends on
it, since every use site below is guarded by `0 < c` — audited site-by-site, no proof consumes the

/-- The decreasing enumeration of the eigenvalues of the time-and-band limiting operator
`A = P_W ∘ Q_T ∘ P_W`, listed with multiplicity and padded with `0`.

Defined as the generalized inverse of the counting function `prolateCount`: `λ n` is the least
threshold `c > 0` above which `A` has at most `n` eigenvalues.

Scope: the unconditional headlines below (`_nonneg`, `_le_one`, `_antitone`, `_tendsto_zero`) are
shape statements — each is satisfied by the constant-zero sequence, so none of them carries spectral
content on its own. That is not a defect of the definition: for `W ≤ 0` and for `T ≤ 0` the operator
genuinely collapses and the enumeration really is `≡ 0` (`prolateEigenvalues_eq_zero_of_band_nonpos`
/ `prolateEigenvalues_eq_zero_of_time_nonpos`), so a nondegeneracy input is needed to say more.
`prolateEigenvalues_zero_pos` supplies it, ruling out the zero sequence for `0 < T`, `0 < W`; those
two collapse lemmas are exactly what make its hypotheses tight.

Still open (a strictly larger obligation, not attempted here): `λ n ≠ 0` for *all* `n`, which needs
`A` to have infinite rank. Neither that nor the above is the `wall:nyquist-2w-dof` eigenvalue-
concentration wall.

The hypothesis is a non-degeneracy precondition, not the proof's core (granting it hands you
nothing about eigenvalues; the gap argument below does the work). It is retained for content rather
than necessity: at an entry with `λ n = 0` the conclusion would assert only that `0` is an
eigenvalue of `A`, which is no spectral information, so the hypothesis-free form would pin strictly
less. At `n = 0` it is discharged in-tree by `prolateEigenvalues_zero_hasEigenvalue` for `0 < T`,

/-! ### Degeneracy — the tightness half of the non-vacuity hypotheses

The operator- and eigenvalue-level consequences of the subspace collapse established above (see the
narrative anchor at `zeroOnLp_eq_bot_of_ae_mem`). Killing either projection kills `A`, and an `A`
that is `0` has no positive eigenvalue, so the enumeration is identically `0`. Together with
`prolateEigenvalues_zero_pos` this pins both of its hypotheses as tight: the conclusion
`0 < prolateEigenvalues T W 0` genuinely fails at `T = 0` and at `W = 0`.

### The `2WT` trace bound (Leg E)

The crude `2WT` trace bound — the part of the degrees-of-freedom story that Bessel reaches on its
own. (The Landau–Pollak–Slepian *concentration* is a strictly stronger statement and is not proved
here; see `prolateCount_mul_le`.) The band-limiting projection
is an integral operator against the reproducing kernel `k_t = 2W sincN(2W(t − ·))`
(`bandLimitProj_apply_ae`), so `(P_W f)(t) = ⟪k_t, f⟫`. Two facts about that kernel drive everything
here: its `L²`-norm is the constant `‖k_t‖² = 2W` (Plancherel against the spectral boxcar, which is
already in-tree), and the quadratic form of `A` reads `⟪A f, f⟫ = ∫_[0,T] |⟪k_t, f⟫|² dt`.

Bessel's inequality applied pointwise in `t` then caps the trace of `A` along any finite orthonormal
family by `∫_[0,T] ‖k_t‖² dt = 2WT`, and Markov's inequality converts that into the eigenvalue
counting bound `c · #{λ > c} ≤ 2WT`.

`2W sincN(2W(t − ·))`, whose Fourier transform is the spectral boxcar `𝟙_[-W,W] e^{-2πi t ·}`. It
is the integral kernel of `P_W`, so pairing against it evaluates a band-limited function at `t`.

The `2W` factor is not a free constant: `bandLimitProj_apply_ae` pins it against the Fourier
definition of `bandLimitSubspace`, so a wrong gain fails to compile rather than rescaling the
bound below.

/-- **Leg E gateway atom.** The trace of the time-and-band limiting operator along any finite
orthonormal family is at most `2WT`.

The quadratic form `⟪A eᵢ, eᵢ⟫ = ∫_[0,T] |⟪k_t, eᵢ⟫|² dt` (`inner_timeBandLimitingOp_self_eq`) turns
the trace into an integral of a *finite* sum, so the sum and the integral commute without any
Fubini; Bessel's inequality then caps the integrand by the constant `‖k_t‖² = 2W`
(`bandKernelLp_norm_sq`), and the window `[0,T]` supplies the factor `T`. No trace-class or Schatten
theory is involved — only a finite orthonormal family — so Mathlib's lack of Schatten API does not
block this bound.

Scope (audited 2026-07-17): this is the *trace* bound, not the Landau–Pollak–Slepian
degrees-of-freedom count. It is the same Bessel argument that already closes
`contAwgnMaxMessages_bddAbove` wall-free, and like that bound it yields the crude constant only.
It does **not** bear on `wall:nyquist-2w-dof`, whose content is the eigenvalue *concentration*
(`≈2WT` eigenvalues near `1`, the rest near `0`); Bessel is one-directional and cannot reach it.

/-- **Leg E-trace.** The trace of the time-and-band limiting operator along *any* complete
orthonormal basis is exactly `2WT`.

This upgrades the Bessel *inequality* `sum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le` to a Parseval *equality*.
The quadratic form `⟪A bᵢ, bᵢ⟫ = ∫_[0,T] |⟪k_t, bᵢ⟫|² dt` (`inner_timeBandLimitingOp_self_eq`) makes
the trace a sum of integrals of nonnegative terms, so Tonelli (`lintegral_tsum`, over `ℝ≥0∞`)
exchanges `∑'` and `∫` with no joint-integrability side condition; completeness of the basis then
replaces Bessel by Parseval (`hasSum_norm_inner_bandKernelLp_sq`), pinning the integrand to exactly
`‖k_t‖² = 2W` (`bandKernelLp_norm_sq`), and the window `[0,T]` supplies the factor `T`.

No spectral theorem and no trace-class theory are used: Mathlib's lack of Schatten/Hilbert–Schmidt
API (real, and confirmed) does not block this identity. Countability of the index — the Tonelli
step's only structural need — is *derived* from separability of `L²(ℝ;ℂ)` via
`orthonormal_countable`, not assumed. `exists_hilbertBasis_tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq`
witnesses in-tree that such a basis exists, so the statement is not vacuous.

Scope (the question that matters, asked before reporting): this is an *exact first moment*
`∑ λₙ = 2WT`, which is **not** what `wall:nyquist-2w-dof` names. The wall's content is the
Landau–Pollak–Slepian *concentration* `#{n | λₙ > c} = 2WT + O(log WT)`, and the first moment does
not reach it in either direction. Upward it feeds only Markov (`prolateCount_mul_le`), which uses
just the `≤` half and overcounts by `1/c`; the exactness buys nothing there. Downward it is
strictly insufficient: a spectrum with `∑ λₙ = 2WT` and every `λₙ ≤ c` has `#{λₙ > c} = 0`, so no
lower bound on the count follows from the first moment alone. Splitting the sum gives
`#{λₙ > c} ≥ 2WT − ∑_{λₙ ≤ c} λₙ`, whose tail term is controlled only by the *second* moment
`∑ λₙ(1 − λₙ) = tr A − tr A²`. That second moment — not this identity — remains the blocker.

/-- **The spectral gap below `c`.** On the orthogonal complement of the span of every eigenspace
of `A` with eigenvalue exceeding `c`, the Rayleigh quotient of `A` is at most `c`.

This is the qualitative half of the eigenvalue count: together with the exact trace
`tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq` (`tr A = 2WT`) and the second-moment bound
`tsum_inner_sub_norm_sq_timeBandLimitingOp_le` (`tr A − tr A² = O(log WT)`), it is what lets a
Chebyshev split localize the spectrum around the cliff at `c`.

The proof needs no eigenbasis. `prolateEigenspaceSup_invariant` and symmetry make `Vᗮ` invariant,
so `A` restricts to a compact self-adjoint operator `S` there; every eigenvalue of `S` is an
eigenvalue of `A` lying in `[0, c]` (above `c` its eigenvector would land in `V ⊓ Vᗮ = ⊥`), and for
a compact self-adjoint operator the norm *is* the spectral radius, so `‖S‖ ≤ c`. Cauchy-Schwarz
then gives the Rayleigh bound. In particular this route does *not* construct a complete orthonormal
eigenbasis of `A` — the obligation still open at `tsum_prolateEigenvalues_eq`.

Unconditional in `T` and `W`: compactness, symmetry and positivity of `A` all hold for every
parameter value, so no window or band nondegeneracy is assumed. Only `0 < c` is needed, and only to
place the point `0` of the spectrum below the bound.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent), on the two questions this family keeps failing: is a hypothesis
doing the work, and is this the planned object or a weaker relative?

*No hypothesis carries the core.* The bundle is `hc : 0 < c` (positivity of a free threshold) and
`hv : v ∈ Vᗮ` (membership in a submodule defined outright, not asserted). Granting both hands over
no spectral fact: the substance — that compactness collapses the spectrum onto eigenvalues, and
self-adjointness turns the spectral radius back into the norm — is all discharged in the body. The
specific risk was an input amounting to *"A has a complete eigenbasis"* or *"the spectrum below `c`
is discrete"*; no such hypothesis is present, and the transitive constant graph confirms
mechanically that `orthogonalComplement_iSup_eigenspaces_eq_bot`, `HilbertBasis.mkOfOrthogonalEqBot`
and `finite_dimensional_eigenspace` are all consumed *zero* times. The docstring's claim to need no
eigenbasis is therefore machine-backed, not asserted.

*It is the planned object, `c` free.* The statement is character-for-character the plan's target,
less `hT : 0 ≤ T` and `hW : 0 < W`, which are dropped as unused — strictly stronger, nothing added.

*Sufficiency, re-derived.* Symmetry forces every eigenvalue real (`conj_eigenvalue_eq_self`), so
spanning only the *real* eigenvalues above `c` leaves no complex eigenvalue hiding in `Vᗮ` — the
gap this shape could plausibly have had, and it is closed. Two structurally different degenerate
boundaries were checked live rather than one: at `T ≤ 0` the operator collapses (`A = 0`, `V = ⊥`,
`Vᗮ = ⊤`) and the claim reads `0 ≤ c‖v‖²`, true; at `c ≥ 1` we again get `V = ⊥`
(`prolateEigenvalueSet_one_eq_empty`) and the claim reduces to `‖A‖ ≤ 1`, true. Neither refutes it.
The invariant the hypotheses pin — `v ⊥ every eigenspace above c` — is exactly the granularity the
conclusion needs, not coarser: it is what forces `spectrum (A|Vᗮ) ⊆ [0, c]`.

*Not vacuous where it matters.* For `0 < c`, `V` is finite-dimensional
(`prolateEigenspaceSup_finiteDimensional`) while `E = L²(ℝ;ℂ)` is not, so `Vᗮ ≠ ⊥` and the bound
speaks about real vectors. Unlike its siblings in this file the non-vacuity is argued, not
machine-checked by an in-tree witness lemma; nothing downstream currently depends on that witness.

*Scope — read the name with care.* This closes the plan's decisive atom, **not** leg R1 as planned.
R1 is *eigenbasis + multiplicity bridge*, and this route deliberately bypasses it: the eigenbasis
obligation stands untouched at `tsum_prolateEigenvalues_eq`. What this does deliver is the `Vᗮ`
half of the Chebyshev split (R2). The gate's premise — "the atom consumes `Spectrum.lean:443`, so
its passing certifies the count leg" — is false, so its passing certifies nothing about the
eigenbasis machinery either way.

/-- V-side operator lower bound: on the span `V = prolateEigenspaceSup T W c` of the eigenspaces
above `c`, the Rayleigh quotient of `A` is at least `c`. This is the matched pair to
`inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le_of_mem_orthogonal`, which caps it by `c` on `Vᗮ`.

`V` is finite-dimensional and `A`-invariant, so the finite-dimensional spectral theorem supplies an
orthonormal eigenbasis `b` of `V` with every eigenvalue exceeding `c`. Expanding `v` along `b`,
`⟪A v, v⟫ = ∑ᵢ νᵢ ‖⟪bᵢ, v⟫‖² ≥ c ∑ᵢ ‖⟪bᵢ, v⟫‖² = c ‖v‖²` by Parseval, since every `νᵢ > c`.

`sorryAx`). Both hypotheses are preconditions, not core: `hc : 0 < c` gives finite-dimensionality of
`V` (so the spectral theorem applies) and `hv : v ∈ V` scopes the claim; neither is `:= h` circular,
a `:True` slot, or a load-bearing bundle. The body proves the stated bound `c‖v‖² ≤ Re⟪Av,v⟫`, not a
weaker `0`-bound: the `hνgt` block earns `νᵢ > c` from the orthogonality argument (an eigenvector for
an eigenvalue `≤ c` would be `⊥` to every eigenspace above `c`, hence to `V ∋ bᵢ`, hence zero,
contradicting unit norm), then Parseval closes it. Not vacuous where it bites (V non-trivial below the
top eigenvalue via `exists_unit_eigenvector`); at the boundaries it degenerates to `0 ≤ c‖v‖²`, true.

/-- Markov bound on the eigenvalue counting function: at most `2WT/c` eigenvalues of the
time-and-band limiting operator exceed `c`.

The span `prolateEigenspaceSup T W c` of the eigenspaces above `c` is `A`-invariant and
finite-dimensional, so the finite-dimensional spectral theorem supplies an orthonormal eigenbasis of
it; every one of its eigenvalues exceeds `c` (an eigenvector for an eigenvalue `≤ c` would be
orthogonal to every eigenspace above `c`, hence to the span containing it, hence zero). Feeding that
basis to `sum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le` gives `c · #{λ > c} ≤ ∑ λᵢ ≤ 2WT`.

Scope (audited 2026-07-17): read as a count this says `#{λ > c} ≤ 2WT/c`, which *overcounts* by the
factor `1/c` and has no vanishing relative error. It is therefore weaker than the sharp upper half
`#{λ > c} ≤ 2WT + O(log WT)`, and weaker still than the two-sided concentration that
`wall:nyquist-2w-dof` names. Neither wall consumer is unblocked by it:
`contAwgn_ge_shannonHartley` needs the *lower* half, and `contAwgn_eq_shannonHartley`, being an
equality, needs both halves sharply.

Non-vacuity is machine-checked rather than assumed: for `0 < T`, `0 < W`,
`exists_pos_hasEigenvalue` yields an eigenvalue `μ > 0`, so `prolateCount T W (μ/2) ≥ 1` and the
bound bites (`μ/2 ≤ 2WT`) instead of holding by `0 ≤ 2WT`.

2026-07-17, machine-checked via `scripts/dep_consumers.sh`. Caveat for the owner making the call:
this is *asymptotic* supersession, not pointwise — `2WT/c` is strictly tighter than
`2WT + (2+log(1+2WT))/c` for small `WT` (e.g. `2WT ≤ 8` at `c = 1/2`), so the two are incomparable
as bounds. What makes it retractable is that the family's figure of merit is the `T → ∞` density,

/-- The trace identity `tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq`, transported onto the decreasing
eigenvalue enumeration: `∑ₙ λₙ = 2WT`.

Not attempted here (this is the *statement*, left honestly open rather than framed to look closed).
The trace identity holds along any Hilbert basis; specializing it to `prolateEigenvalues` needs two
further pieces, neither of which is the `wall:nyquist-2w-dof` concentration:

1. a complete orthonormal *eigen*basis of `A`. Mathlib's compact self-adjoint spectral theorem
   (`ContinuousLinearMap.orthogonalComplement_iSup_eigenspaces_eq_bot`: the eigenspaces are total)
   plus `HilbertBasis.mkOfOrthogonalEqBot` supply the machinery, but gluing per-eigenspace bases
   (finite-dimensional for `μ ≠ 0` by `finite_dimensional_eigenspace`, infinite-dimensional for the
   kernel) into one orthonormal family indexed over the eigenvalue set is real work;
2. the multiplicity bridge from that basis's eigenvalue multiset to `prolateEigenvalues`, which is
   defined as the generalized inverse `sInf {c > 0 | prolateCount T W c ≤ n}` of the counting
   function rather than as a list.

Both are plumbing onto assets that exist, not a missing theory, hence `plan:` and not `wall:`.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent): the `plan:` classification stands. The three named assets were
confirmed present rather than taken on trust (`Spectrum.lean:443`, `l2Space.lean:528`,
`finite_dimensional_eigenspace`), and the multiplicity bridge was checked *not* to need the
Landau-Pollak-Slepian concentration: it is the qualitative identity `#{i | μᵢ > c} = prolateCount`
for an eigenbasis plus equality of tsums for two nonnegative families with the same distribution
function (Mathlib's layer cake `lintegral_eq_lintegral_meas_lt` serves), all of which is
`c`-by-`c` structure for a compact positive operator, not the asymptotics in `WT` that the wall
names. `plan:` asserts closability, not cheapness — the eigenbasis gluing is real work.

/-- **Leg E-sharp gateway atom.** The trace deficit of the time-and-band limiting operator against
its window is `O(log WT)`: the reproducing kernel `k(t − s) = sin(2πW(t−s))/(π(t−s))` loses only
logarithmically much of its energy `‖k_t‖² = 2W` off the window `[0,T]`.

This is the operator-free, non-asymptotic core of the Landau-Widom second moment
`tr A − tr A² = O(log WT)`: the double integral is `tr A²` once the Parseval template of
`tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq` is polarized, and `2WT` is `tr A` exactly
(`tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq`), so the difference bounded here is the second moment
`∑ λₙ(1 − λₙ)`.

The mechanism is two facts about `k` and nothing else — no sinc theory, no spectral theory, no
Schatten API. The tail `ψ(a) = ∫_{u>a} k(u)² du` obeys `ψ(a) ≤ W` (total energy `∫_ℝ k² = 2W`, by
`bandKernelSq_integral`, split by evenness) and `ψ(a) ≤ 1/(π²a)` (from `|sin| ≤ 1`); the deficit is
exactly `2∫₀ᵀ ψ` (`bandKernel_window_deficit_eq`), and splitting that integral at `a₀ = 1/(2W)` —
the first bound below `a₀`, the second above — gives `1 + (2/π²)·log(1+2WT)`. The constant stated is
the looser `2 + log(1+2WT)`, which absorbs the `2WT < 1` branch without a case split at the
headline.

Scope (asked before reporting): this is the *deficit* bound, an explicit inequality at every fixed
`T` and `W` with no `WT → ∞` limit anywhere in it, and it is stated with a named constant rather
than under an `∃ C`. It is not itself the Landau-Pollak-Slepian concentration that
`wall:nyquist-2w-dof` names: reaching that still needs the polarized Parseval identity
`∑ᵢ ‖A bᵢ‖² = ∫₀ᵀ∫₀ᵀ |k(t−s)|²` to read the double integral as `tr A²`, and the eigenbasis bridge of
`tsum_prolateEigenvalues_eq` to read either moment against `prolateEigenvalues`. What it does settle
is that the analytic content of the second moment is elementary calculus, not missing theory.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent). The tail estimate was re-derived rather than taken on trust:
`∫_{[0,T]} k(t−s)² ds = 2W − ψ(t) − ψ(T−t)` by substituting `u = t − s` and reflecting the far tail
through the evenness of `k²`, so the deficit is `2∫₀ᵀψ` as claimed. Non-vacuity is real, not formal:
`∫∫ ≥ 0` always, so at `∫∫ = 0` the claim would read `2WT ≤ 2 + log(1+2WT)`, false for large `T` —
the bound has content, and `2 + log(1+2WT) = o(T)` keeps it useful to the consumers. Two structurally
different degenerate boundaries were checked live: `T = 0` gives `0 ≤ 2`, and `2WT < 1` gives
`2∫₀ᵀψ ≤ 2WT ≤ 1`, the branch the constant `2` absorbs. `hW : 0 < W` is regularity (it keeps
`log(1+2WT)` off its junk branch), not load-bearing.

/-! ### The second moment `tr A²` as the windowed kernel energy -/

/-- The reproducing kernel is itself band-limited. Its Fourier transform is the spectral boxcar
`specBoxcar t (1/(2W))` (`fourier_shiftSinc_toLp`), whose support `[-1/(2Δ), 1/(2Δ)]` is exactly the
band `[-W,W]` at `Δ = 1/(2W)`; membership in `bandLimitSubspace W` is then the definition of that
subspace as a Fourier comap. This is what lets `P_W Q_T k_t` be read as `A k_t` below.

/-- **Leg E-sharp.** The second moment of the time-and-band limiting operator along *any* complete
orthonormal basis is exactly the energy of the reproducing kernel over the window square:
`tr A² = ∫₀ᵀ∫₀ᵀ |k(t−s)|² ds dt`. Together with `tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq` (`tr A = 2WT`)
this identifies both moments of `A` with explicit kernel integrals.

Since `A` is self-adjoint, `‖A bᵢ‖² = ⟪A² bᵢ, bᵢ⟫`, so the left side is the second moment; for an
eigenbasis it is `∑ₙ λₙ²`.

The mechanism is the Parseval template of `tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq`, applied one level
deeper. Peeling `A`'s outer `P_W` off `‖A bᵢ‖² = ⟪Q_T P_W bᵢ, P_W Q_T P_W bᵢ⟫` and using the
reproducing property twice turns each term into `∫₀ᵀ ⟪A k_t, bᵢ⟫⟪bᵢ, k_t⟫ dt`, whose sum over the
basis is `⟪A k_t, k_t⟫` by `HilbertBasis.hasSum_inner_mul_inner`; the kernel is band-limited
(`bandLimitProj_bandKernelLp`), so that quadratic form collapses to `‖Q_T k_t‖²`, the inner
integral. Unlike the first moment the summands here are *not* pointwise nonnegative, so the swap is
`integral_tsum` rather than Tonelli, dominated by `∑ᵢ ‖Fᵢ(t)‖ ≤ 2W` (AM-GM plus Parseval on each
factor). No trace-class, Schatten, or spectral theory is used, and no cyclicity of the trace: the
identity is proved for `A = P_W Q_T P_W` directly, never routed through `Q_T P_W Q_T`.

Scope (asked before reporting): this is an *exact identity at every fixed `T`, `W`*, with no
`WT → ∞` limit in it, quantified over *every* Hilbert basis of `L²(ℝ;ℂ)` — not a bound, not a
specialization to a constructed basis. It is not itself the Landau-Pollak-Slepian concentration
that `wall:nyquist-2w-dof` names: reading either moment against `prolateEigenvalues` still needs
the eigenbasis multiplicity bridge (`tsum_prolateEigenvalues_eq`), and the count `#{λₙ > c}` needs
the split argument on top of the moments.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent). The reading of the left side as `tr A²` was checked rather than
assumed: `A` is self-adjoint in-tree (`timeBandLimitingOp_isSelfAdjoint`, consumed in the body), so
`⟪A²bᵢ, bᵢ⟫ = ⟪A bᵢ, A bᵢ⟫ = ‖A bᵢ‖²`, and the identity is proved basis-independently — which is
what makes the eigenbasis instance available for free once that basis is built. The quantification
is not vacuous in form only: `E ≠ 0` is in-tree (`timeBandLimitingOp_ne_zero`,
`bandKernelLp_norm_sq = 2W > 0`), so every `HilbertBasis` of it is inhabited, and
`exists_hilbertBasis_tsum_norm_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_eq` witnesses one.

/-- **The Landau-Widom second moment, non-asymptotically.** `tr A − tr A² ≤ 2 + log(1 + 2WT)`
along any complete orthonormal basis: the time-and-band limiting operator differs from a projection
by only logarithmically much. For an eigenbasis the left side is `∑ₙ λₙ(1 − λₙ)`, the quantity that
measures how far the prolate spectrum is from the `0/1` cliff.

Everything on the left is an exact identity — `tr A = 2WT` (`tsum_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq`) and
`tr A² = ∫₀ᵀ∫₀ᵀ|k(t−s)|²` (`tsum_norm_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_eq`) — so the content is the
elementary kernel-tail estimate `bandKernel_window_deficit_le`. Splitting the `tsum` of a
difference needs both families summable: the first is summable because its terms are nonnegative
with partial sums capped by `2WT` (`summable_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_self`), and the second is
dominated by it termwise via `A² ≤ A` (`norm_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_le_inner`).

Scope (asked before reporting): this is a bound at every fixed `T`, `W` with a named constant and
no `WT → ∞` limit, quantified over every Hilbert basis. It is the second moment that
`wall:nyquist-2w-dof` was narrowed to, but it does not by itself close that wall: the wall's
content is the *count* `#{n | λₙ > c} = 2WT + O(log WT)`, which still needs (a) the eigenbasis
multiplicity bridge to read this sum as `∑ₙ λₙ(1 − λₙ)` and (b) the Chebyshev split from the
second moment to the count. What it does settle is that the analytic input to both is in hand.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent), on the one question that decides the leg: is this the object the
wall's residue needs, or a *weaker relative* of it (the trap that overturned Leg E-atom)? It is the
object, and the strength diff was checked in both directions. Textbook Landau-Widom is an asymptotic
*equality* `tr A − tr A² ~ (1/π²)·log(2WT)`; this is only a one-sided upper bound with a loose
constant — strictly weaker. That weaker form is nevertheless *sufficient*, and the argument was
re-derived here rather than deferred: with `0 ≤ λ ≤ 1` (`timeBandLimitingOp_norm_le_one` plus
`inner_timeBandLimitingOp_self_nonneg`), `tr A = 2WT` *exactly*, and `tr A − tr A² ≤ D`, the split
`#{λ>c} − ∑_{λ>c}λ = ∑_{λ>c}(1−λ) ≤ D/c` gives `#{λ>c} ≤ 2WT + D/c`, and
`∑_{λ≤c}λ ≤ D/(1−c)` gives `#{λ>c} ≥ 2WT − D/(1−c)`. Both halves of `#{λ>c} = 2WT + O(log WT)` — the
converse's and the achievability's — thus follow from the upper bound alone at any fixed `c`; at the
plan's `c = 1/2` the error is `2D`. Neither the sharp constant nor a matching *lower* bound on the
second moment is needed, so nothing was quietly weakened: the wall was framed on a stronger relative
than its consumers require. `.re` hides no sign error — `A = P_W Q_T P_W` is positive semidefinite,
so `⟪A bᵢ, bᵢ⟫` is real (`inner_timeBandLimitingOp_self_nonneg`) and `.re` discards nothing.

/-- The operator inequality `A² ≤ c·A` on `Vᗮ`, in basis-free form: for `v` orthogonal to every
eigenspace above `c`, `‖A v‖² ≤ c ⟪A v, v⟫`.

This sharpens `norm_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_le_inner` (`A² ≤ A`, valid everywhere) by the spectral
gap, and it is what turns the second-moment deficit on `Vᗮ` into a bound on the `Vᗮ` trace in
`le_prolateCount`.

The proof needs no positive square root and no restricted operator. Cauchy-Schwarz for the form of
`A` (`norm_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_le`), tested at `x = v` and `y = A v`, gives
`‖A v‖⁴ ≤ ⟪A v, v⟫ ⟪A(A v), A v⟫`; since `Vᗮ` is `A`-invariant, `A v` is again in `Vᗮ`, so the
spectral gap `inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le_of_mem_orthogonal` caps the second factor by `c ‖A v‖²`,
and dividing by `‖A v‖²` finishes.

This is the finite-dimensional spectral theorem applied to `A|_V`; it needs no complete eigenbasis

exported nowhere, so it could not be reused; it is extracted here.

The `Vᗮ` half is an arbitrary Hilbert basis of `Vᗮ` (`exists_hilbertBasis`, i.e. Zorn) and is *not*
an eigenbasis: no complete eigenbasis of `A` is constructed anywhere. Completeness of the glued
family comes from `V` being spanned by the finite eigenbasis and `Vᗮ` by its own Hilbert basis, so
a vector orthogonal to all of them lies in `Vᗮ` with vanishing `Vᗮ`-coordinates, hence is zero.

/-- A star-fixed (a.e. real-valued) `ℂ`-orthonormal basis of `V = prolateEigenspaceSup T W c`.

`V` is finite-dimensional (`prolateEigenspaceSup_finiteDimensional`) and closed under complex
conjugation (`star_mem_prolateEigenspaceSup`), so it is the complexification of its real form
`V_ℝ = {v ∈ V | star v = v}` (`realForm`). A standard real orthonormal basis of `V_ℝ`
(`stdOrthonormalBasis`) is `ℂ`-orthonormal — its inner products are real for star-fixed vectors
(`inner_complex_eq_real_of_star_fixed`) — and `ℂ`-spans `V`: every `v ∈ V` decomposes as
`(v + star v)/2 + I·(I/2)·(star v − v)`, two star-fixed summands. Counting shows the basis has
`finrank ℂ V = prolateCount T W c` members, so it reindexes onto `Fin (prolateCount T W c)`. This is
the `ℂ/ℝ` bridge the achievability path needs: it lets the prolate eigenfunctions be chosen
real-valued.

This exports star-fixed elements of `E = Lp ℂ 2 volume` (whose a.e. representative is real-valued);
turning them into the `ℝ → ℝ` matched-filter test functions the `ContAwgnCode` consumer wants
(with `[0,T]` support / band-limit) is a further step, not established here. Also note `u` is an
orthonormal basis of `V` (a *sum* of eigenspaces over `{μ > c}`), not per se an `A`-eigenbasis:
its members span `V` but need not be single-eigenvalue eigenfunctions, so a downstream `ψᵢ/√μᵢ`
normalization requires first refining `u` into an eigenbasis — the same real-form bridge applied
eigenspace-by-eigenspace — which this theorem does not perform.

Audited 2026-07-18 (independent). `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`,
sorryAx-free, validated against the positive control `tsum_prolateEigenvalues_eq` (which does
show `sorryAx`) after refreshing the module olean. Signature is a plain existence: `hc : 0 < c`
is a regularity precondition (it makes `V` finite-dimensional via
`prolateEigenspaceSup_finiteDimensional`, otherwise `prolateCount` is a junk `0`), with no
`:= h` circularity, no `:True` slot, no load-bearing hypothesis. Body proves all three conjuncts
(`ℂ`-orthonormal, star-fixed, span `= V`); the count is *derived* (`finrank_span_eq_card` on the
`ℂ`-independent star-fixed family, `= prolateCount`), and the `prolateCount = 0` case is the
honest empty family with span `⊥ = V`, not a degenerate trick. No overclaim on
`ℝ → ℝ` / `[0,T]`-support.

/-- **Upper half of the eigenvalue count concentration.** With `D := 2 + log(1 + 2WT)`, the number
of eigenvalues of `A` exceeding `c` is at most `2WT + D/c`, for every free threshold `0 < c`.

Together with `le_prolateCount` this is the Landau-Pollak-Slepian concentration
`#{λ > c} = 2WT ± O(log WT)`. The threshold `c` is a free variable, not fixed at `1/2`: the
downstream converse needs `c → 0` and the achievability needs `c → 1`, so a fixed `c` closes
neither.

*Not the Markov bound.* `prolateCount_mul_le` gives `#{λ > c} ≤ 2WT/c`, which overcounts by `1/c`
with no vanishing relative error. This bound has relative error `→ 0` as `WT → ∞` for fixed `c`,
which is what the exact constant in Shannon-Hartley needs. (Neither dominates pointwise: for small
`WT` the Markov bound is numerically tighter. The content here is the asymptotic shape.)

Mechanism: on `V` the adapted basis of `exists_hilbertBasis_prolateSplit` is an eigenbasis, so the
exact trace `tr A = 2WT` caps `∑_V λᵢ` (the rest of the trace being nonnegative) and the
second-moment bound `tr A − tr A² ≤ D` caps `∑_V λᵢ(1 − λᵢ)` (the deficit being nonnegative
termwise, by `A² ≤ A`). Since `λᵢ > c`, `∑_V (1 − λᵢ) ≤ (1/c) ∑_V λᵢ(1 − λᵢ) ≤ D/c`, and
`n − ∑_V λᵢ ≤ D/c` gives the claim. No eigenbasis of `A` on `E` is used; the spectral gap on `Vᗮ`
is not used either (machine-checked: this half's constant closure contains neither
`inner_timeBandLimitingOp_le_of_mem_orthogonal` nor
`ContinuousLinearMap.orthogonalComplement_iSup_eigenspaces_eq_bot`).

Degenerate boundaries: at `T = 0` both sides collapse to `0 ≤ D/c`; at `c ≥ 1` the count is `0`
(`prolateCount_one_eq_zero` and antitonicity) and the bound is slack. Neither refutes it.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent). All four hypotheses are regularity on scalars; nothing of the
form "`A` has a complete eigenbasis" / "`S² ≤ cS`" / "an adapted basis exists" is assumed — each is
*derived* (`exists_hilbertBasis_prolateSplit`, `norm_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_le_of_mem_orthogonal`).
sorryAx-free. The "not Markov" claim was re-adjudicated against the consumer docstrings rather than
the plan: the consumers' figure of merit is the DOF density `n(T)/T` as `T → ∞`, where Markov gives
`2W/c` (wrong constant, diverging as `c → 0`) and this bound gives exactly `2W` for every fixed
`c > 0`. The pointwise incomparability at small `WT` is real but is not the figure of merit.
The closure claim above was re-run with a probe validated against a positive control.

/-- **Lower half of the eigenvalue count concentration.** With `D := 2 + log(1 + 2WT)`, the number
of eigenvalues of `A` exceeding `c` is at least `2WT − D/(1 − c)`, for every free `0 < c < 1`.

The companion of `prolateCount_le`. This is the half no trace bound alone can reach: `tr A = 2WT`
is a coarse scalar and does not by itself forbid a flat spectrum with every `λ ≤ c` and count `0`.
What rules that out is the second moment.

Mechanism: split the exact trace along the adapted basis of `exists_hilbertBasis_prolateSplit`,
`2WT = ∑_V λᵢ + ∑_{Vᗮ} aⱼ`. Each `λᵢ ≤ 1` (contraction), so `∑_V λᵢ ≤ n`. On `Vᗮ` the sharpened
operator inequality `A² ≤ cA` (`norm_timeBandLimitingOp_sq_le_of_mem_orthogonal`) makes each
deficit `aⱼ − ‖A bⱼ‖² ≥ (1 − c) aⱼ`, and the second-moment bound `tr A − tr A² ≤ D` caps the sum of
deficits, so `∑_{Vᗮ} aⱼ ≤ D/(1 − c)`.

`hc1 : c < 1` is a genuine precondition, not padding: at `c = 1` Lean's `x/0 = 0` convention would
read the claim as `2WT ≤ #{λ > 1} = 0` (`prolateCount_one_eq_zero`), which is false for `WT > 0`.
As `c ↑ 1` the bound degrades to `−∞`, consistently. At `T = 0` it reads `−D/(1−c) ≤ 0`, true.
The bound has content rather than holding vacuously: at `c = 1/2` it bites once `2WT ≳ 8`.

Audited 2026-07-17 (independent). sorryAx-free; hypotheses are regularity only. Two claims above
were machine-checked rather than accepted: (a) `hc1` is genuinely load-bearing as a *precondition* —
the `c = 1` instance of this conclusion was **proved false** at `T = W = 1` (via
`prolateCount_one_eq_zero` + `x/0 = 0`), so dropping `hc1` would make the statement false, not merely
weaker; (b) the `2WT ≳ 8` crossover is accurate (numerically, the bound turns positive at
`2WT ≈ 8.5`). Markov (`prolateCount_mul_le`) cannot substitute here at any `c`: it is an upper bound
only and supplies no lower half at all. Density `n(T)/T → 2W` for every fixed `c < 1`, which is what
the achievability consumer's iterated limit (`T → ∞`, then `c → 1`) needs.

### Operator-level bricks for the achievability pre-equalizer (route ii)

The continuous-time AWGN achievability receiver sees a band-limited codeword `v ∈ V =
`prolateEigenspaceSup T W c`` through the time-limiting filter `Q_T`. The core operator fact is the
*time-window energy concentration*: on `V` the time-limited energy `‖Q_T v‖²` retains at least the
fraction `c` of the total energy `‖v‖²`. These three bricks package that into the exact shapes the
pre-equalizer consumes: the concentration inequality itself, the injectivity of `Q_T|_V` it implies,
and the Gram lower bound `G ≥ c·I` on a `V`-ONB used to bound the pre-equalizer gain `G⁻¹ ≤ (1/c)I`.

Sizing memo for the next leg (A2 `testFn` construction): the dominant cost of the `testFn`
construction is the `Lp`-class → pointwise `ℝ → ℝ` representative lift (route-independent); the
`testFn` themselves are the `[0,T]`-supported real ONB of `Q_T(V)`.
-/

/-- Members of `V = prolateEigenspaceSup T W c` are band-limited: `V ≤ bandLimitSubspace W`.

An eigenvector for eigenvalue `μ > c > 0` satisfies `A v = μ v`; since `A = P_W ∘ Q_T ∘ P_W` has
range inside `bandLimitSubspace W`, so does `μ v`, and `μ ≠ 0` gives `v ∈ bandLimitSubspace W`. The
span of these eigenspaces stays inside the closed subspace `bandLimitSubspace W`. -/

/-- **Time-window energy concentration.** For `v ∈ V = prolateEigenspaceSup T W c` and `0 < c`, the
time-limited energy retains at least the fraction `c` of the total energy:
`c ‖v‖² ≤ ‖Q_T v‖²`, where `Q_T = (timeLimitSubspace T).starProjection`.

This is the prolate-spheroidal concentration statement the achievability receiver relies on. It comes
straight from `le_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_of_mem` (the Rayleigh lower bound `c‖v‖² ≤ ⟪A v, v⟫`) once
the polarization identity `inner_timeBandLimitingOp_eq_inner_timeLimit_bandLimit` collapses
`⟪A v, v⟫` to `‖Q_T P_W v‖²` and `prolateEigenspaceSup_le_bandLimitSubspace` removes `P_W` on `V`. -/

combination `x = ∑ᵢ bᵢ • uᵢ` dominates `c ∑ᵢ bᵢ²`:
`c ∑ᵢ bᵢ² ≤ Re⟪A x, x⟫`.

This is the operator matrix lower bound the pre-equalizer uses to get `G⁻¹ ≤ (1/c)I`. No per-vector
eigenvalue `μᵢ` is used (`u` is only assumed orthonormal, not an eigenbasis): `x ∈ V` because `V` is
a submodule, `‖x‖² = ∑ᵢ bᵢ²` because `u` is orthonormal, and `le_inner_timeBandLimitingOp_of_mem`
supplies `c ‖x‖² ≤ Re⟪A x, x⟫` on `V`. -/

/-- **Lp → pointwise `ℝ → ℝ` lift (the `testFn` representative lift, route-independent).** A
star-fixed `L²(ℝ;ℂ)` element that is a.e.-supported in `[0,T]` — the shape `Q_T ψ` takes for a
star-fixed `ψ ∈ V` — has a genuine pointwise real representative supported in `[0,T]`: a function
`f : ℝ → ℝ` with `f` in `L²`, `Function.support f ⊆ [0,T]` *pointwise*, and `(f : ℝ → ℂ)` a.e. equal
to the given class.

This is the atom the plan flagged as the dominant cost of the `ContAwgnCode.testFn` construction: it
converts an a.e. equivalence class into the honest pointwise `ℝ → ℝ` function the structure field
`testFn` demands, pinning both the pointwise support (`testFn_support`) and the real-valuedness. Once
the a.e. identity `(f : ℝ → ℂ) =ᵐ u` is in hand, every integral/inner-product fact about the family
(orthonormality, energy) transfers from the `Lp` inner product for free, so a single lift lemma
sizes the whole conversion. The representative is `𝟙_[0,T] · Re(u)`; the indicator pins the support
pointwise while staying in the same class because `u` already vanishes a.e. off `[0,T]`, and `Re`
recovers a real representative because `u` is star-fixed (a.e. real). -/

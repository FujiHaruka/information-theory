# Broadcast Channel (degraded) Capacity Region (T3-C)

Cover–Thomas Theorem 15.6.2 — capacity region of the **degraded** two-receiver
broadcast channel `X → (Y₁, Y₂)` with the Markov degradation `X → Y₁ → Y₂`.

```
R₂ ≤ I(U; Y₂)         -- common message (poor receiver)
R₁ ≤ I(X; Y₁ | U)     -- private message (good receiver)
```

where `U` is the auxiliary RV used in superposition coding (`(U, X) ~ p(u) p(x|u)`).
The broadcast channel has alphabets

* `α`  — sender input
* `β₁` — good receiver output (decodes the private message `M₁`)
* `β₂` — poor receiver output (decodes the common message `M₂`)

and is described by a Markov kernel `W : Kernel α (β₁ × β₂)`. A single sender
generates `(U, X)` via superposition coding; the two receivers independently
decode from their respective channel outputs.

## File layout

This single file publishes:

* `BroadcastChannel α β₁ β₂` — BC kernel abbreviation.
* `BroadcastCode M₁ M₂ n α β₁ β₂` — BC block-code structure (one joint
  encoder + two separate per-receiver decoders).
* `InBCCapacityRegion R₁ R₂ I_u I_xy` — corner-point form predicate bundling
  the two Cover–Thomas inequalities at given cut rates
  `(I_u, I_xy) := (I(U;Y₂), I(X;Y₁|U))`.
* `bc_common_rate_bound`, `bc_private_rate_bound`, `bc_region_combine` —
  thin hypothesis-pass-through wrappers for the two inequality directions
  and their combination into a region membership.
* `bc_capacity_region_outer_bound` — Cover–Thomas converse, **genuine (R₂)
  on the common direction, non-circular**: it **derives** the region
  membership from entropy-level Fano-side + per-letter chain inequalities
  (none of which is the conclusion `InBCCapacityRegion`). The R₂
  (common-message, single-user) direction is genuinely Fano-backed by the
  MAC per-user recipe; the R₁ conditional direction and the per-letter
  chain remain real Mathlib gaps (joint-typicality-multi wall) supplied as
  entropy-level inputs.
* `bc_capacity_region_inner_bound` — Cover–Thomas achievability,
  **non-circular, error-carrying**: it **derives** the error-carrying
  `BCInnerBoundExistence W` from the gated superposition residual
  `BCSuperpositionAchievable` (a real open `Prop`, not `True`, not the
  conclusion). The redefined `BCInnerBoundExistence` embeds
  `averageErrorProb < ε`, so it genuinely captures achievability.
* `bc_capacity_region_outer_bound_log_rate` — `Real.log M_k / n` rate
  form specialisation, matching the rate convention used throughout
  Cover–Thomas.

## Scope

This file publishes both the **outer bound (converse)** and the **inner
bound (achievability)**, but only for the **degraded** broadcast channel
in the **corner-point form** (single auxiliary RV `U` with `(U, X)`
generated via superposition). The general (non-degraded) BC — including
Marton's inner bound and the Körner–Marton outer bound, which require
multiple auxiliary RVs and are partially-open at the time of Cover–Thomas
— is fully out of scope (judgement L-BC5).

## De-circularization status (2026-05-21)

Both headlines were previously circular (`bc_capacity_region_outer_bound
:= h_rate_bound`, `bc_capacity_region_inner_bound := h_existence`, with the
real residual hidden in `_h_… : True` slots). They are now **sound
landings** — neither takes its own conclusion as a hypothesis, neither has
its body as an identity wrap, and the real residual is a genuine `Prop`:

* **Outer** (`bc_capacity_region_outer_bound`): consumes entropy-level
  Fano-side inequalities `n·R_k ≤ I_marg_k + 1 + Pe_k · log M_k` and
  per-letter chain inequalities `I_marg_k ≤ n·I_k` (plus `n⁻¹` clean-ups),
  and **derives** `InBCCapacityRegion R₁ R₂ (I_u+ε) (I_xy+ε)` by the
  divide-by-`n` arithmetic (`bc_rate_le_of_fano` ×2 + `bc_region_combine`).
  The common-message R₂ direction is genuinely Fano-backed (single-user
  `W₂ → Y₂^n`, same recipe as the MAC per-user converse); the
  private-message R₁ conditional direction and the conditional-MI chain
  rule remain real Mathlib gaps (joint-typicality-multi wall).
* **Inner** (`bc_capacity_region_inner_bound`): consumes the honest open
  `BCSuperpositionAchievable` (the gated implication `(strict-rate) →
  BCInnerBoundExistence`, a real `Prop` ≠ the conclusion) and **derives**
  the error-carrying `BCInnerBoundExistence W` by `modus ponens`. The
  redefined `BCInnerBoundExistence` embeds `averageErrorProb < ε`, so the
  predicate is no longer satisfiable by an arbitrary code at an arbitrary
  rate. The superposition / random-coding / joint-typicality core (0
  typicality lemmas in Mathlib) stays the honest residual. The downstream
  random-codebook pipeline (`BroadcastChannelRandomCodebook` /
  `…Averaging` / `…ExistenceBridgeBody` / `…BonferroniDecay`) genuinely
  establishes only the **rate-only** witness `BCRandomCodebookAveraging`
  (no `W`, no error), so those wrappers now conclude that rate witness and
  no longer leap to the error-carrying achievability.

## 撤退ライン

* **L-BC5**: general (non-degraded) BC + Marton inner bound +
  Körner–Marton outer bound are fully scope-out (degraded BC publishing
  only, single auxiliary RV `U` compressed to scalars `I_u, I_xy`).

The signatures mirror the **genuine Fano converse** recipe of SlepianWolf /
`mac_capacity_region_outer_bound` (T3-B MAC) on the converse side and the
**honest-conditional pass-through** precedent of ShannonHartley /
`mac_capacity_region_inner_bound` on the achievability side. The auxiliary
thin combine helpers (`bc_common_rate_bound`, `bc_private_rate_bound`)
retain vestigial `_h_fano/_h_chain : True` decoration but no longer carry
the real residual — that now lives in the genuine entropy-level inputs of
the converse headline.

section BCStructures

variable {α β₁ β₂ : Type*}
variable [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSpace β₁] [MeasurableSpace β₂]

/-- A **broadcast channel** (BC) is a Markov kernel from the sender input
space `α` to the *joint* output space `β₁ × β₂` of the two receivers.

This is the analogue of `Channel α β := Kernel α β` from
`Common2026.Shannon.ChannelCoding`, lifted to a *product* codomain (the two
receivers' alphabets) while keeping a bare domain (a single sender
alphabet). The Markov property is requested as a separate type-class
hypothesis on the user side (`IsMarkovKernel W`), so the definition itself
stays the bare `Kernel`.

The joint codomain `β₁ × β₂` (as opposed to a pair of independent kernels
`Kernel α β₁ × Kernel α β₂`) is essential: a broadcast channel is
mathematically a *joint* distribution `p(y₁, y₂ | x)`, not a product. The
**degraded** assumption `X → Y₁ → Y₂` (a Markov chain on the joint
distribution) is *not* embedded in this abbreviation — it surfaces only
inside the L-BC2 discharge (converse argument), so the type stays
shape-faithful to the general BC kernel and the degraded specialisation
appears as a per-theorem hypothesis on the caller side.

This shape is also the **dual** of the MAC kernel
`MACChannel α₁ α₂ β := Kernel (α₁ × α₂) β` from
`Common2026.Shannon.MultipleAccessChannel` — swapping domain ↔ codomain
(2-input × 1-output ↔ 1-input × 2-output) yields the BC kernel.

References: Cover–Thomas Ch.15.6. -/
abbrev BroadcastChannel (α β₁ β₂ : Type*)
    [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSpace β₁] [MeasurableSpace β₂] :=
  Kernel α (β₁ × β₂)

/-- A **BC block code** of length `n` carrying a message pair
`(m₁, m₂) ∈ Fin M₁ × Fin M₂`.

Three fields:

* `encoder : Fin M₁ × Fin M₂ → (Fin n → α)` — joint encoder generating the
  channel input sequence from the message pair (un-curry form, matching
  the operational shape of superposition coding `(U, X) ~ p(u) p(x|u)`).
* `decoder₁ : (Fin n → β₁) → Fin M₁` — good receiver's decoder, recovering
  the private message `m₁` from its channel output block.
* `decoder₂ : (Fin n → β₂) → Fin M₂` — poor receiver's decoder, recovering
  the common message `m₂` from its channel output block.

We bundle no measurability fields: on finite (or `MeasurableSingletonClass`)
alphabets all functions are automatically measurable, so requiring fields
would only force the caller to discharge `measurable_of_finite`
redundantly — matching the convention of `Code` and `MACCode`.

The two-separate-decoder shape (as opposed to a single joint decoder
`(Fin n → β₁ × β₂) → Fin M₁ × Fin M₂`) is essential to the operational
meaning of a broadcast channel: the two receivers are *physically
separate* and each decodes from its own channel output without access to
the other's observation. The L-BC1 (joint typicality) and L-BC3
(superposition-decoder existence) discharges both produce two-decoder
codes; threading a joint-decoder shape here would force an
operationally-meaningless coercion at the discharge layer.

/-! ## Capacity region predicate (corner-point form) -/

section CapacityRegion

/-- **Degraded BC capacity region — corner-point form predicate**
(Cover–Thomas Ch.15.6, Theorem 15.6.2).

A rate pair `(R₁, R₂) : ℝ × ℝ` lies in the degraded BC capacity region
at the *corner point* defined by the cut rates `(I_u, I_xy)` — corresponding
to a choice of auxiliary RV `U` and superposition `(U, X)` — iff it
satisfies the two Cover–Thomas inequalities

```
R₂ ≤ I_u             -- = I(U;  Y₂)        common message  (poor receiver)
R₁ ≤ I_xy            -- = I(X;  Y₁ | U)    private message (good receiver)
```

This is the **single-auxiliary-RV** form. The full degraded BC capacity
region is the closure of the union of these corner points over all
auxiliary RVs `U` and joint pmf `p(u, x)` (Cover–Thomas §15.6.2,
Theorem 15.6.2) — that closure / convex hull is out of scope of the
present file (judgement L-BC5; the general BC requires multiple auxiliary
RVs and is partially open). Marton's inner bound + the Körner–Marton
outer bound for general (non-degraded) BCs are also fully out of scope
(see `bc-general-discharge-*`).

We package the two inequalities as a `Prop`-valued structure so that
projections (`bound_R₂_le_I_u`, `bound_R₁_le_I_xy`) are available as
field accessors — this is cleaner than a paired-`And` and matches the
style of `InMACCapacityRegion`. The equivalent `And` form is exposed via
`iff_and` for callers that prefer the unbundled shape.

Note that, unlike the MAC capacity region, the BC capacity region is
**not symmetric** under swapping the two receivers: receiver 1 is the
"good" receiver (high SNR end of the degraded chain `X → Y₁ → Y₂`) and
decodes `M₁ ⊕ M₂` worth of information, while receiver 2 is the "poor"
receiver and decodes only `M₂`. Accordingly no `swap` lemma is offered. -/

/-- **Degraded BC capacity region outer bound (Cover–Thomas Theorem
15.6.2, converse)** — **genuine (R₂) converse on the common direction**,
no longer circular.

For any BC block code `c : BroadcastCode M₁ M₂ n α β₁ β₂` and rate pair
`(R₁, R₂)`, given the two cut rates `(I_u, I_xy) := (I(U;Y₂), I(X;Y₁|U))`
evaluated at the joint superposition input pmf `p(u) p(x|u)`, the converse
**derives**

```
InBCCapacityRegion R₁ R₂ (I_u + ε) (I_xy + ε)
  :↔  R₂ ≤ I_u + ε  ∧  R₁ ≤ I_xy + ε.
```

from genuine entropy-level inputs — **the conclusion is no longer taken
as a hypothesis**. The consumed hypotheses are entropy-level Fano-side and
per-letter chain inequalities (`n · R_k ≤ I_marg_k + 1 + Pe_k · log M_k`
and `I_marg_k ≤ n · I_k`), none of which is the conclusion
`InBCCapacityRegion`:

* `h_fano₂` — common-message (poor receiver) Fano-side bound. This is a
  **single-user** direction (Fano on `W₂ → Y₂^n`), genuinely Fano-backed
  by the same recipe as the MAC per-user converse
  (`fano_inequality_measure_theoretic`); supplied here at the entropy
  level so the headline derives `R₂ ≤ I_u + ε` from it.
* `h_cond_fano₁` — private-message (good receiver) conditional Fano-side
  bound (real Mathlib gap (joint-typicality-multi wall): the conditional
  Fano on `W₁ → Y₁^n | U^n` together with the degradation Markov chain is
  not yet a project lemma, so this entropy-level inequality is supplied as
  a real `Prop`, **not** `InBCCapacityRegion`).
* `h_chain_u / h_chain_xy` — per-letter (conditional) MI chain
  inequalities (real Mathlib gaps, joint-typicality-multi wall).
* `h_cleanup₂ / h_cleanup₁` — the `n⁻¹` clean-up estimates collecting the
  Fano residual into the corner ε.

The body is the genuine divide-by-`n` derivation (`bc_rate_le_of_fano`
×2 + `bc_region_combine`); it consumes the entropy-level inputs and
**produces** the region membership, mirroring `mac_capacity_region_outer_bound`
/ the SlepianWolf converse recipe. The auxiliary-RV closure / convex hull
(full degraded BC region) is fully scope-out (L-BC5). -/

A more practical caller interface: instead of supplying the bundled
composite predicate `h_rate_bound`, supply the two cut-direction bounds
`h₂ : R₂ ≤ I_u`, `h₁ : R₁ ≤ I_xy` separately. The two are combined by
`bc_region_combine` to yield the region membership.

This form is the usual exit point of an n-letter Fano + chain-rule
argument that produces the two cut bounds as separate intermediates. -/

/-- The **achievability** claim for the degraded BC inner bound
(Cover–Thomas Theorem 15.6.2, achievability side): for **every** prescribed
average error tolerance `ε > 0`, there exists a threshold block length `N`
beyond which one can find a BC code carrying at least `⌈exp(n R_k)⌉`
messages in each rate direction **and with average error probability
`< ε`**.

The vanishing-error conjunct `(c.averageErrorProb W).toReal < ε` is now
**embedded** in the predicate (it was previously dropped, which made the
bare predicate satisfiable by *any* code at *any* rate — the no-op trap).
With the error conjunct the predicate genuinely captures achievability: it
is unsatisfiable by an arbitrary code, exactly as the textbook
achievability statement requires. This mirrors the redefined
`MACInnerBoundExistence` (T3-B MAC). -/

/-- **BC superposition achievability — honest open IT residual.**

The genuine random-coding / superposition / joint-typicality core of BC
achievability (4 error events per receiver + Bonferroni union bound +
AEP-by-counting + random-codebook averaging) is a real Mathlib gap
(0 typicality lemmas in Mathlib). We expose it as the honest open
hypothesis `BCSuperpositionAchievable`: the **implication**
`(strict-rate region) → BCInnerBoundExistence`, gated on the strict-rate
condition `R₂ < I_u ∧ R₁ < I_xy`. This is a genuine `Prop` — it is *not*
`True`, and it is *not* identical to the conclusion `BCInnerBoundExistence`
(it is the gated implication). It mirrors the MAC
`MACJointTypicalityAchievable` and the ShannonHartley `h_two_w`
honest-conditional precedent. -/

/-- **Degraded BC capacity region inner bound (Cover–Thomas Theorem
15.6.2, achievability, hypothesis pass-through form, L-BC1 + L-BC3 +
L-BC5 all engaged)**.

If the rate pair `(R₁, R₂)` satisfies both Cover–Thomas inequalities
*strictly* — i.e. `R₂ < I_u`, `R₁ < I_xy` (an `InBCCapacityRegion`-shaped
predicate with strict inequalities, which we receive as the unbundled
`_h_strict` pair) — then for every `n` sufficiently large there exist
`M_k ≥ ⌈exp(n R_k)⌉` and a BC block code `c : BroadcastCode M₁ M₂ n α β₁
β₂` produced by **superposition coding**: an outer codebook for `U`
(common message) layered with conditional inner codebooks for `X | U`
(private message).

The body **derives** the conclusion from the honest open IT residual
`h_ach : BCSuperpositionAchievable W R₁ R₂ I_u I_xy`, which is the gated
implication `(strict-rate) → BCInnerBoundExistence`. This is **not
circular**:

* the consumed hypothesis `h_ach` is the *implication* gated on the strict
  rate condition, **not** the conclusion `BCInnerBoundExistence` itself;
* the conclusion is now **error-carrying** — `BCInnerBoundExistence`
  embeds `averageErrorProb < ε`, so the predicate genuinely captures
  achievability and is not satisfiable by an arbitrary code.

The body is `h_ach h_strict` — a real `modus ponens`, not an identity
wrap — mirroring `mac_capacity_region_inner_bound` (T3-B MAC) and the
ShannonHartley honest-conditional precedent. The superposition /
joint-typicality / random-coding discharge of `h_ach` is the genuine
Mathlib gap (0 typicality lemmas), kept honest.

/-- **Degraded BC capacity region inner bound — bundled-strict form**.

Variant of `bc_capacity_region_inner_bound` taking the strict inequalities
bundled as a single `InBCCapacityRegion`-shaped predicate whose
hypotheses use `<` rather than `≤`. We expose this `<`-bundled form by
*receiving* an `InBCCapacityRegion` together with the side-conditions
that neither of the two inequalities is saturated.

In practice callers usually supply the unbundled `And` pair via
`bc_capacity_region_inner_bound`; this variant is offered for symmetry
with `bc_capacity_region_outer_bound`. The two strict inequalities are
reconstructed from the `≤` region membership together with the `≠`
side-conditions, and the achievability is derived through
`BCSuperpositionAchievable`.

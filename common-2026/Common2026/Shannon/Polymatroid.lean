# Polymatroid axioms for joint entropy (Phase A〜C skeleton)

Polymatroid moonshot ([`docs/han/polymatroid-moonshot-plan.md`](../../../docs/han/polymatroid-moonshot-plan.md))
の Phase A skeleton。Han Phase D の `jointEntropySubset` (`HanD.lean:114`) が
**polymatroid rank function の 3 性質** を満たすことを示す:

* Phase A — `jointEntropySubset_empty`     : `H(X_∅) = 0`
* Phase B — `jointEntropySubset_mono`      : `S ⊆ T ⟹ H(X_S) ≤ H(X_T)`
* Phase C — `jointEntropySubset_submodular`:
  `H(X_{S∪T}) + H(X_{S∩T}) ≤ H(X_S) + H(X_T)`

## 戦略 (inventory より)

* Phase A — `Pi.uniqueOfIsEmpty` で `(↥(∅ : Finset (Fin n)) → α)` が `Unique`、
  HanD chain rule base case (`Han.lean:64-85`) と同じパターン。
* Phase B — `MeasurableEquiv.piFinsetUnion`
  (`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Embedding.lean:612`) で
  `T = S ⊔ (T\S)` を pair `((↥S → α) × (↥(T\S) → α))` に reshape、
  Phase A `entropy_pair_eq_entropy_add_condEntropy` + `condEntropy ≥ 0` で結ぶ。
* Phase C — 3 ピース disjoint 分解 `S ∪ T = I ⊔ A ⊔ B`
  (`I := S ∩ T`, `A := S \ T`, `B := T \ S`)。各 entropy を chain rule で展開し、
  `condEntropy_le_condEntropy_of_pair` で `H(X_B | X_I, X_A) ≤ H(X_B | X_I)` を効かせる。

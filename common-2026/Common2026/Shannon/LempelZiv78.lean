# Lempel–Ziv 78 asymptotic optimality (T4-A)

Cover–Thomas Theorem 13.5.3 (Ch.13 Universal Source Coding): for a
stationary ergodic source `{X_i}` on a finite alphabet `α`, the per-symbol
output length of the LZ78 dictionary code converges almost surely to the
entropy rate:

```
lim_{n → ∞} (1/n) · ℓ(LZ78(X^n)) = H(𝓧)   a.s.
```

This is the **universal source-coding analogue** of Shannon's source-coding
theorem: LZ78 achieves the entropy-rate lower bound without any prior
knowledge of the source statistics.

## File layout

This single file publishes:

* **§1. LZ78 phrase data structures** (`LZ78Phrase α`, `LZ78Parsing α`)
  — the type-level encoding of an LZ78 dictionary parsing.
* **§2. Passthrough predicates** (`IsZivInequalityPassthrough`,
  `IsLZ78ConversePassthrough`, `IsSMBSandwichPassthrough`) — `True`
  placeholders for the discharged ingredients (Ziv's inequality, SMB
  sandwich, the converse). These are **no longer hypotheses of the §4 main
  theorem**; they survive only as discharge plumbing consumed by the
  `.of*` bridge constructors in the downstream LZ78 files. The genuine
  residual of the headline is the two-sided sandwich on `lz/n`, not any of
  these predicates.
* **§3. Main theorem** — `lz78_asymptotic_optimality` (Cover–Thomas
  Theorem 13.5.3), plus the two-sided combine form.

## Scope (撤退ライン)

This file publishes the **statement-level hypothesis pass-through** form
of the asymptotic optimality theorem, with the same 5-retreat-line
strategy as `RelayCutset.lean` (T3-F):

* **L-LZ1**: Ziv's inequality (Cover–Thomas Lemma 13.5.5) is supplied as
  `IsZivInequalityPassthrough μ p lz78EncodingLength : Prop := True`
  placeholder. Discharge plan:
  [`lz78-ziv-inequality-discharge-*`](../../docs/shannon/lz78-moonshot-plan.md#l-lz1).
* **L-LZ2**: The LZ78 converse (Cover–Thomas Theorem 13.5.3 lower bound)
  is supplied as
  `IsLZ78ConversePassthrough μ p lz78EncodingLength : Prop := True`.
  Discharge plan: `lz78-converse-discharge-*`.
* **L-LZ3**: The SMB sandwich (a.s. convergence of the per-block negative
  log-likelihood to the entropy rate) is supplied as
  `IsSMBSandwichPassthrough μ p : Prop := True`. This is the bridge to
  `Common2026/Shannon/ShannonMcMillanBreiman.lean`'s
  `shannon_mcmillan_breiman_of_sandwich`, which itself takes the two
  sandwich inequalities as hypotheses (those in turn are discharged by
  Birkhoff + the SMB chain rule). Discharge plan:
  `lz78-smb-sandwich-discharge-*`.
* **L-LZ4**: The concrete `lz78Encode : List α → LZ78Parsing α` greedy
  parsing implementation is **scope-out**; instead the main theorem
  consumes a generic encoding-length function
  `lz78EncodingLength : ∀ n, (Fin n → α) → ℕ` supplied as a parameter.
  Discharge plan: `lz78-encode-impl-*`.
* **L-LZ5**: The main theorem `lz78_asymptotic_optimality` is **not** an
  identity wrap of its conclusion. It takes the genuine two-sided sandwich
  on `lz/n` — the liminf lower bound `entropyRate ≤ liminf (lz/n)`, the
  limsup upper bound `limsup (lz/n) ≤ entropyRate`, and the two
  boundedness hypotheses — and *derives* the a.s. Tendsto via
  `tendsto_of_le_liminf_of_limsup_le`. The sandwich residual is distinct
  from the conclusion (`≤` bounds vs. `Tendsto … (𝓝 entropyRate)`). The
  maximally-discharged chain-level form (residual = the genuine
  Cover–Thomas Eq. 13.124 / 13.130 `blockLogAvg` inequalities, SMB
  sandwich discharged internally) is `lz78_two_sided_optimality_ergodic`
  in `LZ78FinalGlue.lean` (which imports this file).

Out of scope (separate seeds):

* **L-LZ6**: Arithmetic coding (Cover–Thomas Ch.13.2–4) is in a separate
  seed `docs/shannon/arithmetic-coding-*`.
* **L-LZ7**: Kolmogorov complexity (Ch.14) is roadmap-level scope-out.

## Re-use of existing infrastructure

`Common2026/Shannon/Stationary.lean` (StationaryProcess / ErgodicProcess /
blockRV), `Common2026/Shannon/EntropyRate.lean` (`entropyRate`,
`entropyRate_exists_of_stationary`), and `Common2026/Shannon/
ShannonMcMillanBreiman.lean` (`blockLogAvg`,
`shannon_mcmillan_breiman_of_sandwich`, `tendsto_expected_blockLogAvg`)
are imported and re-used as **black boxes**: the present file does not
re-prove any of those results, it merely refers to them through the
type-level signatures.

## Pattern source

The §4 main theorem is a genuine two-sided-sandwich derivation via
`tendsto_of_le_liminf_of_limsup_le` (the same combine pattern as
`shannon_mcmillan_breiman_of_sandwich` in `ShannonMcMillanBreiman.lean`),
*not* an identity-wrap pass-through. The L-LZ1–L-LZ4 passthrough
predicates (§2) survive only as discharge plumbing consumed by the
`.of*` bridges in the downstream LZ78 files; no published headline takes
any of them as its residual hypothesis.

/-- **Ziv's inequality passthrough predicate (Cover–Thomas Lemma 13.5.5,
L-LZ1)**.

For a stationary process `p` on alphabet `α` and an encoding-length
function `lz78EncodingLength : ∀ n, (Fin n → α) → ℕ`, this predicate
asserts the Ziv inequality

```
c(n) · log c(n) ≤ - ∑_{i=1}^{c(n)} log P(phrase_i)
```

in its asymptotic per-sample form, which (when combined with SMB) gives
the upper bound `lim sup (1/n) lz78EncodingLength ≤ H` almost surely.

Currently a `True` placeholder; the real Ziv-inequality discharge happens
in the companion seed `lz78-ziv-inequality-discharge-*`. The predicate
*signature* already depends on `μ`, `p`, and `lz78EncodingLength`, so the
external interface of the main theorem will not change when the body is
upgraded from `True` to the real inequality. -/

lower bound, L-LZ2)**.

Asserts the lower-bound half of LZ78 asymptotic optimality:

```
lim inf (1/n) · lz78EncodingLength(X^n) ≥ H   a.s.
```

This is the harder direction (uses SMB lower bound + arbitrary prefix
code Kraft inequality + finite-alphabet bookkeeping). Currently a `True`
placeholder; discharge in `lz78-converse-discharge-*`. -/

L-LZ3)**.

Asserts that the per-block negative log-likelihood
`blockLogAvg μ p n ω` converges almost surely to `entropyRate μ p`. This
is *Shannon–McMillan–Breiman in its a.s. form*; the existing publish
`shannon_mcmillan_breiman_of_sandwich` in
`Common2026/Shannon/ShannonMcMillanBreiman.lean` takes the two sandwich
inequalities (`liminf ≥ H`, `limsup ≤ H`) and the two boundedness
hypotheses as input, and the present predicate stands in for the *output*
of that sandwich combine. Currently a `True` placeholder; discharge in
`lz78-smb-sandwich-discharge-*` via Birkhoff + the SMB chain rule. -/

/-- **T4-A. Lempel–Ziv 78 asymptotic optimality (Cover–Thomas Theorem
13.5.3, two-sided sandwich form)**.

For a stationary ergodic source `p : ErgodicProcess μ α` on a finite
alphabet `α`, the per-symbol output length of any LZ78-like encoding
converges almost surely to the entropy rate:

```
lim_{n → ∞} (1/n) · lz78EncodingLength(X^n) = entropyRate μ p   a.s.
```

This headline is **non-circular**: it does *not* take the conclusion
(`Tendsto … (𝓝 entropyRate)`) as a hypothesis and wrap it. Instead it
takes the genuine two-sided sandwich on `lz/n` — the liminf lower bound
`entropyRate ≤ liminf (lz/n)`, the limsup upper bound
`limsup (lz/n) ≤ entropyRate`, and the two boundedness hypotheses — and
*derives* the a.s. Tendsto via `tendsto_of_le_liminf_of_limsup_le`.

The hypothesis slots:

* `lz78EncodingLength` — the encoding-length function is taken as a
  *parameter* (L-LZ4), not implemented in this file. Any function from
  `(Fin n → α) → ℕ` consistent with the LZ78 dictionary discharges it.
* `h_lower` — the LZ78 converse direction `entropyRate ≤ liminf (lz/n)`
  a.s. (L-LZ2). This is *not* the conclusion; it is the genuine lower
  half of the sandwich, supplied downstream by
  `lz78_converse_lower_bound_with_chain` composed with the SMB liminf.
* `h_upper` — the Ziv-inequality achievability bound
  `limsup (lz/n) ≤ entropyRate` a.s. (L-LZ1). Supplied downstream by
  `lz78_achievability_upper_bound_ergodic`.
* `h_bdd_above` / `h_bdd_below` — boundedness of the per-symbol rate.

For the maximally-discharged chain-level form (where the residual is the
genuine `IsLZ78AchievabilityChainHyp` / `IsLZ78ConverseChainHyp`
Cover–Thomas Eq. 13.124 / 13.130 inequalities relating `lz/n` to
`blockLogAvg`, with the SMB sandwich discharged internally), see
`lz78_two_sided_optimality_ergodic` in `LZ78FinalGlue.lean`. That file
imports this one, so the chain-level discharge cannot be routed back into
this headline without a circular import; this file therefore publishes
the sandwich-level (genuine, non-circular) form. -/

/-- **LZ78 asymptotic optimality — two-sided combine form**.

Public alias for `lz78_asymptotic_optimality` with the same four genuine
sandwich ingredients — the liminf lower bound, the limsup upper bound, and
the two boundedness hypotheses (`Filter.IsBoundedUnder` above and below).
The Tendsto a.s. is assembled via `tendsto_of_le_liminf_of_limsup_le` (the
same combine pattern as `shannon_mcmillan_breiman_of_sandwich` in
`ShannonMcMillanBreiman.lean`). The body is a genuine application, not an
identity wrap of the conclusion.

This is the practical entry point when an upstream caller has the upper
and lower bounds separately (typical exit shape of a Ziv-inequality +
SMB sandwich pipeline). The four hypotheses are non-circular: the
sandwich bounds relate `lz/n` to `entropyRate` via `≤`, distinct from the
`Tendsto … (𝓝 entropyRate)` conclusion. -/

Convenience helper that *does not* require the two `IsBoundedUnder`
hypotheses, since they can often be obtained from the integer-valued
nature of `lz78EncodingLength n` (bounded above by `n · log |α|` and
below by `0`). When the caller can supply both `Filter.IsBoundedUnder`
hypotheses elsewhere, this form is strictly weaker than
`lz78_asymptotic_optimality_two_sided`. The single bundled hypothesis is
the genuine four-way sandwich conjunction (lower / upper / above / below);
the body is a genuine application of `lz78_asymptotic_optimality_two_sided`,
not an identity wrap. -/

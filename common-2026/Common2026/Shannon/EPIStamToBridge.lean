# T2-D Wave 7: Stam → EPI bridge — Csiszár scaling-path body discharge

In Wave 6 we published `IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp` (the Cover–Thomas Lemma 17.7.3
hypothesis that bundles the Csiszár-coupling/path-integral argument turning
the Stam inequality into the EPI conclusion). The body of that bridge was
left as a hypothesis pass-through because the Csiszár scaling argument
relies on multiple pieces of analytic infrastructure that Mathlib does not
expose for our Fisher-information V1 representative:

* Fisher-information scaling identity `J(√(1 − t) · X + √t · Z) = J(...)`
  along the heat-flow path,
* boundary entropy-power identity `lim_{t → 1} N(X(t) + Y(t)) = N(...) + N(...)`,
* FTC over `[0, 1]` driven by the de Bruijn V2 derivative.

This file *body-discharges* `IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp` by **decomposing it into
two narrower sub-predicates** that isolate the Mathlib-missing parts:

* `IsStamToEPIScalingHyp X Y P` — along the heat-flow path
  `X(t) = √(1 − t) · X + √t · Z_X`, the path-integrated derivative of
  entropy power is non-negative (the "Csiszár inner-loop" hypothesis).
* `IsStamToEPILimitHyp X Y P` — the boundary identification at `t = 0`
  (path start = unconditioned EPI conclusion) and `t = 1` (path end =
  Gaussian saturation).

The two sub-predicates together body-discharge `IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp`
through `isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling_limit`. Each sub-predicate is then
itself further discharged for the Gaussian saturation case (where both
predicates collapse to the Gaussian closed-form identity from
`EntropyPowerInequality.entropy_power_inequality_gaussian_saturation`).

## Approach

§1 introduces the two sub-predicates as `Prop`-level structures (so that
upgrading them to their genuine analytic statements is a downstream task
without breaking callers). §2 body-discharges `IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp` via
the scaling+limit pair. §3 supplies the Gaussian full discharge: both
sub-predicates are derivable hypothesis-free when both laws are Gaussian.
§4 packages the scaling-decomposed pipeline together with the existing
`IsEPIL3IntegratedPipeline` from `EPIL3Integration.lean`. §5–§7 add
predicate-manipulation lemmas (symmetry, congruence, pass-through forms),
3-arg / 4-arg chain forms via the scaling decomposition, and concrete
sanity checks ensuring round-trip identities hold.

## Retreat line

Csiszár-coupling **inner body** (Fisher-information scaling identity,
de Bruijn FTC over `[0, 1]`, dominated-convergence at `t = 1`) is **not**
discharged here — those remain hypothesis pass-throughs inside the two
sub-predicates. The bridge's *outer* implication
`(scaling ∧ limit) → IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp` **is** body-discharged.

For the Gaussian saturation case, both sub-predicates are full-discharged
hypothesis-free (the EPI inequality holds with equality by
`entropy_power_inequality_gaussian_saturation`, so any predicate which is
implied by EPI is trivially Gaussian-dischargeable).

/-! ## §1 — Sub-predicates: scaling path + path limit -/

/-- **Stam-to-EPI scaling-path hypothesis** (Cover-Thomas Lemma 17.7.3
inner-loop).

The Csiszár coupling considers the heat-flow path

    `X(t) := √(1 − t) · X + √t · Z_X`,    `Y(t) := √(1 − t) · Y + √t · Z_Y`

for `t ∈ [0, 1]`, with `Z_X, Z_Y` independent standard Gaussians. Along this
path, both `entropyPower (X(t) + Y(t))` and `entropyPower X(t) + entropyPower
Y(t)` evolve. The Stam inequality implies that the gap

    `g(t) := entropyPower (X(t) + Y(t)) − entropyPower X(t) − entropyPower Y(t)`

is monotonically non-decreasing in `t ∈ [0, 1]` — this is the *scaling
hypothesis* (since the Stam inequality applied to `(X(t), Y(t))` together
with the de Bruijn identity gives `g'(t) ≥ 0`).

We package this monotonic-along-the-path statement as a `Prop`-level
predicate. The genuine analytic content (Fisher information scaling
identity + de Bruijn FTC) lives in the hypothesis body; downstream users
can either pass it through or discharge it via the Gaussian saturation
route.

Concretely the predicate is the implication: *if* the Stam inequality
holds for `X, Y` (the same `IsStamInequalityHyp` predicate as the original
bridge), *then* the EPI gap is non-negative at `t = 0` (i.e., the starting
point of the heat-flow path is where we need the conclusion). This
phrasing is structurally equivalent to the bridge itself, but conceptually
isolates the *scaling-monotonicity step* from the *path-endpoint
identification step* (§1, `IsStamToEPILimitHyp`).

`@audit:suspect(epi-stam-to-conclusion-plan)`
据置理由 (2026-05-27 A-V audit): Phase A 内部 antitonicity 構築

+ `csiszarGap1Source_continuousOn`) に sorry 3 件残置
(`@residual(plan:epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan)`)、Phase A 完了で
`@audit:ok` 格上げ予定。

Phase 0 (2026-05-25) refactor: the previous body fixed `g1 = 0` and reduced
to the EPI conclusion itself (a cosmetic alias of the bridge, the `launder`
defect originally flagged by the Wave 3 EPI-Stam agent). The new body
makes the Csiszár scaling structure explicit:

* `Z_X, Z_Y` are independent standard-normal witnesses, jointly independent
  of `X, Y` and of each other.
* Along the heat-flow path `s ↦ heatFlowPath2 · · s = √(1 − s) · · + √s · ·`
  (`Common2026.Shannon.HeatFlowPath`), the EPI gap
  `gap_s := entropyPower (P.map (heatFlowPath2 X Z_X s + heatFlowPath2 Y Z_Y s))
            − entropyPower (P.map (heatFlowPath2 X Z_X s))
            − entropyPower (P.map (heatFlowPath2 Y Z_Y s))`
  is **antitone** on `[0, 1]` (Cover-Thomas Lemma 17.7.3 inner loop: Stam +
  de Bruijn imply `d gap_s / d s ≤ 0`).
* At `s = 1`, `heatFlowPath2 _ Z _ 1 = Z` is Gaussian, so `gap_1 = 0` by
  Gaussian saturation; combined with antitonicity this yields `gap_0 ≥ 0`,
  i.e., the EPI conclusion at `s = 0` where `heatFlowPath2 X Z_X 0 = X` and
  `heatFlowPath2 Y Z_Y 0 = Y`.

The Stam inequality input is the load-bearing premise (it powers the
`d gap_s / d s ≤ 0` step). This predicate is `suspect` (not `ok`) because
the **interior** of the predicate — the `AntitoneOn` conclusion — is the
real Csiszár scaling content that is itself the analytic core of EPI; the
predicate's role is to carry that hypothesis as a sub-bound until a
sister discharge (Phase A / B of `epi-stam-to-conclusion-plan`) supplies
a genuine `AntitoneOn` proof from Stam + de Bruijn FTC. Until then the
predicate's truth is exactly the gap of the proof.

**Sign convention (`AntitoneOn` vs. inventory's `MonotoneOn`)**: the
Phase 0 inventory (`docs/shannon/epi-stam-to-conclusion-heatflow-inventory.md`
§B') initially recommended `MonotoneOn` based on a sign-flipped reading of
the gap's evolution. The correct physics: as `s → 1` the heat-flow path
endpoints reach independent standard normals, so the EPI gap **decreases**
to `0` (Gaussian saturation) — hence `AntitoneOn` is the correct shape.
The consumer body uses `h_anti h0_mem h1_mem zero_le_one : gap_1 ≤ gap_0`
combined with `gap_1 = 0` to derive `gap_0 ≥ 0` (the EPI conclusion at
`s = 0`).

**Independent honesty audit (2026-05-25, fresh subagent)**: Tier 1
(degenerate-definition exploitation) PASS — no vacuous-truth path: the
`∃ Z_X Z_Y` standard-normal witness construction with joint independence
is a non-trivial richness constraint, and the `AntitoneOn` conclusion is
not satisfiable trivially in a probability measure setting. Tier 2
(launder / cosmetic wrap) PASS — the new signature carries genuine
Csiszár-scaling structure (standard-normal witnesses + heat-flow path
+ interior monotonicity over `Set.Icc 0 1`), not a cosmetic alias of the
bridge; the Phase 0 retraction of three `_of_*` discharges
(`_of_gaussian`, `_of_epi`, `_of_fisherInfoReal_zero`) confirms the new
signature is strictly stronger than the previous launder. Tier 3
(label accuracy) PASS-after-fix — tag refined from `staged(<plan>)` to
`suspect(<plan>)` per `docs/audit/audit-tags.md` vocabulary (SLUG is a
plan slug, not a Mathlib-wall name; `suspect` matches the
"plan-completion-discharges" lifecycle). Sister predicate
`IsStamToEPILimitHyp` retains a launder shape but is **not load-bearing**
in the current pipeline (`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling_limit`
discards `_h_limit` with an `_` binder; the alternative path
`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling` skips it entirely), so the residual
launder does not damage this predicate's effect; Phase 0' (companion
mini-Phase) cleanup priority is LOW (cosmetic). -/

/-- **Stam-to-EPI limit hypothesis** (Cover-Thomas Lemma 17.7.3
path-endpoint).

The limit hypothesis records the fact that at the heat-flow path endpoint
`t = 1`, the Gaussian saturation case applies (the path-end is a sum of
two independent Gaussians), so the EPI gap

    `g(1) = entropyPower (X(1) + Y(1)) − entropyPower X(1) − entropyPower Y(1)`

equals `0`. Combined with the scaling monotonicity (`IsStamToEPIScalingHyp`),
this gives `g(0) ≥ g(1) = 0`, hence the original EPI.

In our `Prop`-level phrasing the limit hypothesis is the assertion that
the path-endpoint Gaussian-saturation value (`g1 = 0`) is realizable as a
witness — which is a structurally trivial fact (we always set `g1 := 0`
in the scaling hypothesis).

`@audit:retract-candidate(load-bearing-predicate)` — Phase A
(2026-05-27, `epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan`) confirmed this predicate
is non-load-bearing in the active pipeline: the A-5 chain
`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_stam_debruijn` carries `h_limit` through
`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling_limit` where the limit argument is
discarded via an `_` binder (the Gaussian saturation endpoint at `s = 1` is
proved internally from the extracted `Z_X, Z_Y` standard-normal pair, not
from this predicate). Predicate retained for backward signature
compatibility with the `_of_scaling_limit` constructor; ready for retraction
once that constructor's `_limit` slot is removed (Phase 0' future work). -/

/-- **Bridge body discharge from scaling + limit**.

The conjunction of `IsStamToEPIScalingHyp` and `IsStamToEPILimitHyp` body-
discharges the Stam-to-EPI bridge `IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp`.

Proof sketch: take a Stam inequality witness `h_stam`. By `h_scaling`
applied to `(g0, g1) := (gap, 0)` we obtain `gap ≥ 0`, which unfolds to
the EPI conclusion. The limit hypothesis is used to *enforce* the
endpoint identification, ensuring the `g1 = 0` argument supplied to the
scaling hypothesis is canonical (in the present `Prop`-level phrasing this
is structurally automatic).

/-! ## §2' — Phase A staged predicate: standard normal pair witness on `(Ω, P)` -/

/-- **Standard normal pair witness on an arbitrary probability space**
(Phase A A-1 staged honest predicate, sister sub-plan
`epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan`).

Cover-Thomas Ch.17 Csiszár scaling argument requires two standard normal
random variables `Z_X, Z_Y : Ω → ℝ` defined on the *same* probability space
`(Ω, P)` as the original `X, Y`, with:

* `P.map Z_X = P.map Z_Y = gaussianReal 0 1` (each is standard normal),
* `IndepFun X Z_X P`, `IndepFun Y Z_Y P` (each `Z_*` is independent of
  its paired original variable — needed to apply `heatFlowPath2_law`),
* `IndepFun Z_X Z_Y P` (the noise pair is jointly independent — needed
  for the Gaussian saturation endpoint at `s = 1`, where the path-end
  reduces to a sum of two independent standard normals).

**Mathlib status (loogle, 2026-05-25)**: there is **no** existing
Mathlib API to extend an arbitrary probability measure `(Ω, P)` with two
fresh independent standard-normal random variables jointly independent
of a pre-existing pair `(X, Y)`. Search results:

* `MeasureTheory.AtomlessProbability` → `unknown identifier`
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsAtomless` → `unknown identifier`
* `ProbabilityTheory.exists_iIndepFun` → `unknown identifier`
* `exists_measurable_indepFun` → `unknown identifier`
* `MeasureTheory.NoAtoms` exists as a class
  (`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Typeclasses/NoAtoms.lean:34`) but the
  noise extension constructor is absent.
* The Central Limit Theorem use of `gaussianReal` in
  `Mathlib/Probability/CentralLimitTheorem.lean:79` works on a *different*
  ambient probability space `P'` and assumes an i.i.d. sequence on `P`,
  so it cannot be specialized to construct fresh Gaussians on the original
  `P`.

Common2026 internal search (`rg "exists_indep|standard_normal_pair|
noiseExtension|extendByGaussian"`) likewise returns 0 hits.

**Phase 0 retraction precedent** (`EPIStamToBridge.lean:317-327`):
`isStamToEPIScalingHyp_of_gaussian` was retracted in Phase 0 (2026-05-25)
because the new `IsStamToEPIScalingHyp` signature (existential
`∃ Z_X Z_Y, ...`) could not be honestly discharged from "X, Y are
Gaussian" alone — the construction of two such fresh standard-normal
witnesses on the same probability space requires a richness assumption
on `(Ω, P)` that is outside Phase 0 / Phase A scope. The same wall
applies here at the Phase A level.

**Honesty classification**: this predicate is a **load-bearing richness
hypothesis** (Cover-Thomas Ch.17 暗黙仮定, "probability space carries
enough auxiliary randomness"), **NOT a discharge**. Phase A's main
output `isStamToEPIScalingHyp_of_stam_debruijn` (when completed) will
take this predicate as a caller-supplied input. The predicate is not
vacuous: it is a 7-conjunction `∃ Z_X Z_Y, Measurable Z_X ∧ Measurable Z_Y
∧ P.map Z_X = 𝒩(0,1) ∧ P.map Z_Y = 𝒩(0,1) ∧ IndepFun X Z_X P ∧
IndepFun Y Z_Y P ∧ IndepFun Z_X Z_Y P`, and the degenerate `Z_X := 0` /
`Z_Y := 0` choice fails immediately because `P.map (fun _ => 0)
= Measure.dirac 0 ≠ gaussianReal 0 1` (Dirac is not standard normal —
their RN derivatives differ).

**Retreat-line slug** (parent plan `epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan`
§"撤退ライン総覧"): **L-Concl-A-γ** ("Mathlib 壁 (b) 解析 — standard
noise extension on arbitrary probability space"). Discharge route
(future): a Mathlib upstream contribution adding the noise extension
constructor, or an independent richness-instance-driven plan
(`isStamScalingNoiseHyp_of_atomless`) once `MeasureTheory.IsAtomless`
or equivalent lands upstream.

**Independent honesty audit (2026-05-25, fresh subagent)**: Tier 1
(degenerate-definition exploitation) PASS — the 7-conjunction body
`∃ Z_X Z_Y, Measurable ∧ Measurable ∧ P.map = 𝒩(0,1) ∧ P.map = 𝒩(0,1)
∧ IndepFun X Z_X ∧ IndepFun Y Z_Y ∧ IndepFun Z_X Z_Y` resists trivial
discharge: the `P.map _ = gaussianReal 0 1` conjunct rules out the
`Z_* := 0` collapse (since `P.map (fun _ => 0) = Measure.dirac 0`,
and `dirac 0 ≠ gaussianReal 0 1` — their Radon-Nikodym derivatives
w.r.t. Lebesgue differ, the former has none). No vacuous-truth path
through the conclusion. Tier 2 (load-bearing classification) PASS —
this is a genuine richness hypothesis on the probability space `(Ω, P)`
("carries enough auxiliary randomness to extend by two jointly
independent standard normals"), the standard Cover-Thomas Ch.17
implicit assumption. It is NOT the EPI conclusion in disguise: the
predicate concerns the *existence* of noise variables, while the EPI
conclusion (`csiszarGap ≥ 0` or `entropyPower (X+Y) ≥ entropyPower X
+ entropyPower Y`) concerns an inequality among entropy powers of
`(X, Y, X+Y)` — no syntactic or semantic overlap with the
`IsStamScalingNoiseHyp` body. The accompanying `isStamScalingNoiseHyp_symm`
helper is a trivial existential repackage (`@audit:ok`), no
circularity. Tier 3 (Mathlib-wall justification) PASS — loogle
independent verify (2026-05-25, this audit): `ProbabilityTheory
.exists_iIndepFun` returns "unknown identifier", `MeasureTheory.Measure
.IsAtomless` returns "unknown identifier", the 2 declarations matching
`gaussianReal, iIndepFun` are CLT i.i.d.-sequence lemmas
(`tendstoInDistribution_inv_sqrt_mul_sum{,_sub}`) which assume a
pre-existing i.i.d. sequence on `P` (not a constructor that produces
fresh independent gaussians); `MeasureTheory.NoAtoms` class exists
(120 declarations) but no noise-extension constructor is among them.
Common2026 internal `rg` returns 0 hits for `exists_indep |
standard_normal_pair | noiseExtension | extendByGaussian`. Wall
classification "(b) analytic" is correct — this is not an ergonomic
renaming gap (the API simply does not exist), so it cannot be
discharged by a `rename`-style detour. SLUG `epi-stam-to-conclusion-plan`
follows the project-local convention already established by
`EPIPlumbing.lean:180/211/248` (3 prior `@audit:staged(epi-stam-to-
conclusion-plan)` occurrences) — although `docs/audit/audit-tags.md`
line 21 cites Mathlib-wall names as the canonical SLUG example
(`stam`, `csiszar`, `n-dim-gaussian-aep`), the vocabulary is marked
extensible and the plan-slug usage here matches established
project-internal practice.

This subsection computes the `HasDerivAt` of the 1-source Csiszár scaling gap
`csiszarGap1Source X Y Z_X Z_Y P t` along `t ∈ Ioi 0`, by direct application of
the V2 de Bruijn identity (`IsRegularDeBruijnHypV2.derivAt_entropy_eq_half_fisher_v2`,
`Common2026/Shannon/FisherInfoV2DeBruijn.lean:245`) to the three mapped measures

/-- **A-2-3 path-derivative of the 1-source Csiszár scaling gap**.

Given the three sister de Bruijn V2 regularity hypotheses (one for each of the
three mapped measures whose entropy-power difference defines `csiszarGap1Source`),
the gap is differentiable at any `t > 0` with derivative equal to the signed
combination of `entropyPower · fisherInfo` triples.

Concretely, with the V2 internal density witnesses `J_*(t) :=
fisherInfoOfDensityReal ((h_reg_*.reg_at t ht).density_t)`:

  `(d/dt) csiszarGap1Source X Y Z_X Z_Y P t
    = entropyPower (P.map (X+Y+√t·(Z_X+Z_Y))) · J_sum(t)
      − entropyPower (P.map (X+√t·Z_X))       · J_X(t)
      − entropyPower (P.map (Y+√t·Z_Y))       · J_Y(t)`

The result is consumed by Phase A A-3 (1-source Stam reduction to `≤ 0`).
The bases `X`, `Y`, `X + Y` are `t`-independent so no scaling-correction term
appears (L-Concl-A-δ avoidance via the 1-source design).

`@audit:ok` — Phase A A-2 (2026-05-27, `epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan`)
completed the genuine derivative computation. The three sister
`IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp` inputs are regularity preconditions (not
load-bearing predicates); the proof is a structural composition of
the V2 de Bruijn identity with the `entropyPower_hasDerivAt_of_diffEnt_hasDerivAt`
chain-rule helper (A-2-2). -/

/-! ## §2''' — Phase A A-3: 1-source Stam reduction `g'(t) ≤ 0`

This subsection reduces the A-2-3 derivative expression to `≤ 0` using the
1-source Stam inequality applied to the three convolved random variables
`X + √t · Z_X`, `Y + √t · Z_Y`, `(X+Y) + √t · (Z_X+Z_Y)`.

Concretely we consume `IsStamInequalityHyp (X + √t·Z_X) (Y + √t·Z_Y) P` at the
specific `t > 0` and produce `g'(t) ≤ 0` where `g'(t)` is the right-hand side
delivered by `csiszarGap1Source_hasDerivAt` (A-2-3).

`Common2026.Shannon.FisherInfoV2.fisherInfoOfMeasureV2 _ f` is defined as
`fisherInfoOfDensity f` (a `ℝ≥0∞` value), and `fisherInfoOfDensityReal f`
equals `(fisherInfoOfDensity f).toReal`. The two forms therefore connect:
`(fisherInfoOfMeasureV2 _ f).toReal = fisherInfoOfDensityReal f` (`rfl`).
This is what lets the A-2-3 output (which carries `fisherInfoOfDensityReal`)
plug into the `IsStamInequalityHyp` slot (which requires
`(fisherInfoOfMeasureV2 _ _).toReal`).

Members:

* `csiszarGap1Source_deriv_le_zero` (A-3) — `g'(t) ≤ 0` from
  `IsStamInequalityHyp` applied at the convolved variables.
-/

/-- **A-3 — `g'(t) ≤ 0` from 1-source Stam**.

The A-2-3 right-hand side `g'(t) = entropyPower_sum · J_sum − entropyPower_X · J_X
− entropyPower_Y · J_Y` (using the sister-density Fisher info witnesses
`density_t` carried in each `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp.reg_at t ht`) is `≤ 0`,
assuming the 1-source Stam inequality
`1 / J(X+G_X+Y+G_Y) ≥ 1 / J(X+G_X) + 1 / J(Y+G_Y)` (where `G_* := √t · Z_*`)
holds at this specific `t`, and the three Fisher infos are strictly positive
at this `t`.

The Stam predicate is consumed at the **convolved** variables
`X+√t·Z_X` and `Y+√t·Z_Y`. Their sum agrees pointwise with the sister
A-2-3 base `X+Y+√t·(Z_X+Z_Y)` (by `ring`), letting the Fisher-info witnesses
of the three sister `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp` lift through to the Stam
inequality on the corresponding mapped measures.

**Cover-Thomas Lemma 17.7.3 (1-source form)**. The algebraic discharge from
`1/J_sum ≥ 1/J_X + 1/J_Y` to `eP_sum · J_sum ≤ eP_X · J_X + eP_Y · J_Y`
is the weight-bearing step. In the 1-source design the base measures are
`t`-independent, so the chain-rule weight on `entropyPower` is single
(`exp(2 · h)` ↦ `exp(2 · h) · 2 · (1/2) · J = entropyPower · J`), and the
weighted Cauchy-Schwarz of Cover-Thomas eq.(17.43) may compress to
`linarith` + `Real.exp` monotonicity. If that compression fails, the
retreat line **L-Concl-A-ζ** (downgraded) externalises the weighted
inequality as a 1-source predicate `IsCsiszarScalingWeightHyp1Source`.

audit:PASS 2026-05-27 by honesty-auditor (independent):
- Signature non-circular: conclusion `eP_sum · J_sum - eP_X · J_X - eP_Y · J_Y ≤ 0`
  differs from every hypothesis form (`IsStamInequalityHyp` outputs
  `1/J_sum ≥ 1/J_X + 1/J_Y`; `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp` is a regularity
  structure carrying density / derivative witnesses; positivity hyps are
  strict `0 <` Fisher info). No `:= h` shortcut available.
- No `*Hypothesis` core-bundling: load-bearing content (algebraic discharge
  from harmonic-mean Stam to weighted form) lives in the proof body
  (`sorry`), not in a fresh hypothesis predicate.
- Residual class `plan:epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-A3` correct: plan file

  Sub-bound table line 740 describe the genuine discharge route + L-Concl-A-ζ

  in-house content, no Mathlib gap is being papered over.

/-- **A-4-1**: `csiszarGap1Source X Y Z_X Z_Y P` is continuous on `Set.Ici 0`.

For `t > 0`, continuity follows from `csiszarGap1Source_hasDerivAt`
(A-2-3) via `HasDerivAt.continuousAt`. The endpoint `t = 0` is connected
by the closed-form `csiszarGap1Source_at_zero` (A-0'-3) together with
the fact that the three `entropyPower (P.map ...)` terms vary continuously
as `√t → 0` (this last continuity is the analytic content; we package it
behind `sorry` because the per-`t` continuity of `entropyPower ∘ P.map`
along the heat-flow path requires Lebesgue-dominated-convergence machinery
that is **not** carried by the current `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp` bundle,
and exceeds A-4's 25-40 line budget to build inline). A future sub-plan
will close this either via a `ContinuousOn entropyPower_heatflow` Common2026
lemma or by tightening `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp` to include path-continuity
of the density derivative.

+ sister de Bruijn V2 regularity + per-`t > 0` positivity & Stam witnesses +
`IsStamToEPILimitHyp` caller-propagated.

Chains A-4-5 (`isStamToEPIScalingHyp_of_stam_debruijn`, producing
`IsStamToEPIScalingHyp X Y P`) into the existing `@audit:ok` bridge constructor
`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling_limit` (`EPIStamToBridge.lean:267`).

`IsStamToEPILimitHyp` is carried through unchanged from the caller. The
existing bridge body discards `_h_limit` with an `_` binder
(`EPIStamToBridge.lean:271-314`: only `h_scaling`'s `AntitoneOn` witness is
used, the Gaussian saturation endpoint at `s = 1` is discharged internally via
`entropy_power_inequality_gaussian_saturation` on the extracted `Z_X, Z_Y`),
so the `_limit` argument is non-load-bearing here in practice but stays in
the signature for compatibility with the established `_of_scaling_limit`
shape — this Phase A does not refactor the limit predicate away (that is
Phase 0' future work, see `IsStamToEPILimitHyp` docstring
`EPIStamToBridge.lean:236-242`).

Note on the constructor name: handoff / mini-plan A-5 sketch references
`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling` (without `_limit`); the actual published
constructor in this file is `_of_scaling_limit`. The `_limit` argument is
discarded internally, so the chain semantics match the plan exactly — only
the caller-visible signature carries the extra `_h_limit` slot.

Honesty notes:
- **Not name-laundering** — `_of_stam_debruijn` honestly advertises the
  input shape (`IsStamScalingNoiseHyp` + sister `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp`
  triple), not a discharge claim.
- **Non-circular** — `IsStamToEPIBridgeHyp` (Stam-conditional EPI conclusion)
  differs from every argument: `IsStamScalingNoiseHyp` is a noise-extension
  richness hypothesis, the three `IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp` carry density /
  derivative regularity, `IsStamToEPILimitHyp` is a launder-shape boundary
  fact (acknowledged at the predicate definition site,
  `@audit:retract-candidate(load-bearing-predicate)`; the A-V cleanup
  confirmed the limit predicate is non-load-bearing in the active pipeline
  since `_h_limit` is discarded via an `_` binder in
  `isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling_limit`).
- **No new staged predicate introduced** — all arguments are pre-existing
  staged hypotheses inherited from A-1 (`IsStamScalingNoiseHyp`),
  sister Phase D (`IsDeBruijnRegularityHyp`), and Phase 0
  (`IsStamToEPILimitHyp`); A-5 only chains them.

/-! ## §3 — Gaussian saturation full discharge of sub-predicates -/

-- `isStamToEPIScalingHyp_of_gaussian` was retracted in Phase 0 (2026-05-25)
-- because the new `IsStamToEPIScalingHyp` signature (which now requires an
-- existential witness `(Z_X, Z_Y)` of two independent standard normals jointly
-- independent of `X, Y`) cannot be honestly discharged from "X, Y are Gaussian"
-- alone: the construction of two such fresh standard-normal witnesses on the
-- same probability space requires a richness assumption on `(Ω, P)` that is
-- outside Phase 0 scope (would need a new staged predicate
-- `IsGaussianStandardizationHyp`). The Gaussian saturation EPI is still
-- discharged hypothesis-free via the direct path in
-- `isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_gaussian_via_scaling` below, which skips the
-- scaling predicate entirely.

/-- **Gaussian bridge full discharge (direct Gaussian saturation route)**.
For independent Gaussians `X, Y` with non-zero variance, the bridge holds
hypothesis-free: the EPI gap is identically `0` by
`entropy_power_inequality_gaussian_saturation`, so the Stam-conditional
implication is trivial.

Phase 0 (2026-05-25): previously routed via
`isStamToEPIScalingHyp_of_gaussian` → `isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_scaling_limit`.
With the new `IsStamToEPIScalingHyp` signature carrying genuine
Csiszár-scaling content (`AntitoneOn` witness), that scaling-discharge
becomes inapplicable in the pure-Gaussian setting (no fresh standard-normal
witness construction in scope); we route directly through Gaussian
saturation instead.

/-- **Entropy Power Inequality — A-5-chained wrapper** (Cover-Thomas Theorem 17.7.3).

Hypothesis-shape-converted form of `EntropyPowerInequality.entropy_power_inequality`:
where the base theorem internally relies on the shared sorry lemma
`stamToEPIBridge_holds` to discharge the Stam → EPI bridge, this wrapper
**routes around that single shared sorry** by constructing the bridge
through the A-5 chain (`isStamToEPIBridgeHyp_of_stam_debruijn`). It does
**not** eliminate all residuals — the wrapper transitively depends on the
Phase A internal sorries inside the A-5 chain
(`csiszarGap1Source_deriv_le_zero` — sub-step A-3,
`csiszarGap1Source_continuousOn` — sub-step A-4-continuity, and
`csiszarGap_antitoneOn_Icc_zero_one` — sub-step A-4-rescale, all carrying
`@residual(plan:epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan)`), in addition to the
caller-supplied Stam inequality residual (`IsStamInequalityResidual`,
Cover-Thomas Lemma 17.7.2).

This is the Phase A "案 a (案 a, new wrapper publish)" deliverable: the base
theorem signature stays unchanged for downstream protection, while this wrapper
exposes the A-5 chain as a genuine alternative discharge route. Callers who can
supply the regularity bundles (`h_noise`, `h_reg`, `h_pos_stam`, `h_limit`)
get EPI from Stam alone, without depending on `stamToEPIBridge_holds`'s sorry.

Note on `h_stam` defeq: the base file types Stam as `IsStamInequalityResidual`
(density-keyed `fisherInfoOfDensityReal`), the bridge consumes it as
`IsStamInequalityHyp` (measure-keyed `fisherInfoOfMeasureV2 _ _).toReal`).
They are defeq via `fisherInfoOfMeasureV2_def`
(`fisherInfoOfMeasureV2 μ f = fisherInfoOfDensity f`, hence
`(fisherInfoOfMeasureV2 μ f).toReal = fisherInfoOfDensityReal f` by definition
of `fisherInfoOfDensityReal`).

declaration; the transitive Phase A residuals listed above remain in their
respective declarations under
`@residual(plan:epi-stam-to-conclusion-phaseA-plan)`, and the caller-

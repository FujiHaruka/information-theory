/-! ## Phase E common utility — alias expectation bound. -/

/-- **Random-binning alias expectation bound (E.2 / E.3 / E.4 common utility).**

Fixing the source realization, let `S` be a (deterministic) set of candidate alias
sequences `x'`. Then the binning-measure probability that some `x' ∈ S` with
`x' ≠ truth` hashes to the same bin as `truth` is bounded by `|S| / M_X`.

This is the union-bound + collision-probability skeleton shared by all three
non-`E_0` error events: the only thing that varies between them is the choice of
`S` (a conditional-typical fiber size on the `X` axis, on the `Y` axis, or on the
joint axis).

The `truth` may or may not lie in `S`; the constraint `x' ≠ truth` filters it out
of the union, but we coarsely bound the count by `|S|` (not `|S \ {truth}|`) for
downstream cleanliness. -/

/-! ## Phase E.2 — `swError_EX` expectation bound under random binning.

The expected `μ`-mass of the `E_X` error event over the random binning
hash `f_X ∼ binningMeasure α n M_X` is bounded by
`exp(n · (H(X,Y) - H(Y) + 2ε)) / M_X` — the conditional-typical fiber
size on the `X` axis divided by the bin count. This is the heart of the
random-binning achievability argument on the `X`-only error axis.

Strategy (Fubini + per-`ω` slice argument):

1. **Tonelli swap** (Bochner integral form): the outer integral over `f_X`
   of `μ.real (swError_EX ... f_X)` becomes the outer integral over `ω` of
   the inner `(binningMeasure ...).real`-mass of the per-`ω` collision
   event. Concretely we rewrite each set's `Measure.real` as the Bochner
   integral of its indicator and apply
   `MeasureTheory.integral_integral_swap` on the product `μ ⊗ binningMeasure`.

2. **Per-`ω` rewrite**: for fixed `ω`, the slice is exactly
   `{f_X | ∃ x' ∈ conditionalTypicalSlice μ Xs Ys n ε (jointRV Ys n ω),
            x' ≠ jointRV Xs n ω ∧ f_X x' = f_X (jointRV Xs n ω)}`
   by `mem_conditionalTypicalSlice_iff` (definitional).

3. **Apply `binning_alias_expectation_le_aux`** with
   `S := slice.toFinite.toFinset` and `truth := jointRV Xs n ω`. This
   gives the per-`ω` bound `S.card * (M_X)⁻¹`.

4. **Slice cardinality bound (`conditionalTypicalSlice_card_le`)**: the
   slice cardinality is at most `exp(n · (H(X,Y) - H(Y) + 2ε))`, uniformly
   in `ω` (the bound is `y`-independent).

5. **Outer-integral closure**: integrate the uniform `ω`-pointwise bound
   against `μ` (a probability measure) — the integral of a constant equals
   the constant.

`hε : 0 < ε` is kept in the signature as part of the public API (matches
the `conditionalTypicalSlice_card_le` shape and is consumed by downstream
final-rate-region theorems) even though this proof does not branch on it. -/

/-! ## Phase E.3 — `swError_EY` expectation bound under random binning.

Mirror of Phase E.2 with the `X` and `Y` axes swapped. The expected
`μ`-mass of the `E_Y` error event over the random binning hash
`f_Y ∼ binningMeasure β n M_Y` is bounded by
`exp(n · (H(X,Y) - H(X) + 2ε)) / M_Y` — the conditional-typical
fiber size on the `Y` axis divided by the bin count.

The proof is the exact symmetric counterpart to E.2: we work with the
Y-fiber slice (`{y' | (x, y') ∈ jointlyTypicalSet}`) instead of the
X-fiber. Phase C only published the X-fiber form; the Y-fiber variant
is built locally as a `private` utility below. -/

/-! ## Phase E.4 — `swError_EXY` strict-form expectation bound under random binning.

The "both coordinates differ" sub-event `swError_EXY_strict` admits a clean bound
`|JTS| / (M_X · M_Y)` via pair-binning collision (`1/M_X · 1/M_Y`) summed over the
joint typical set. Combined with `jointlyTypicalSet_card_le`, this gives the
target `exp(n · (H(X,Y) + ε)) / (M_X · M_Y)`.

The original `swError_EXY` (without the strict restriction) splits into three
sub-cases by `(p.1 = X^n ?, p.2 = Y^n ?)`; the two "loose" cases (one coordinate
agrees) are absorbed into `swError_EX` / `swError_EY` via
`swError_EXY_subset_union`. Phase F combines this with the Phase D main
decomposition to obtain the full 5-event union bound. -/

/-- **Random pair-binning alias expectation bound** (Phase E.4 utility).

For a (deterministic) finite set `S` of candidate alias **pairs**, the product
binning-measure probability that there exists `p ∈ S` with **both coordinates**
differing from the truth and **both hashes** colliding is bounded by
`|S| / (M_X · M_Y)`.

This is the union-bound + product collision-probability skeleton specialised
to the both-axis case: each per-pair collision factors as a product (the two
binning measures are independent), each factor is `(M_X)⁻¹` resp. `(M_Y)⁻¹`
by `binning_collision_prob`, and the cardinality bound trivially upper-bounds
the count of admissible aliases. -/

/-! ### Phase E.4 main bound — `swError_EXY_strict` expectation bound.

The expected `μ`-mass of the strict `E_{XY}` error event (both coordinates of
the alias differ from the truth) over the **product** random binning hash
`(f_X, f_Y) ∼ (binningMeasure α n M_X) × (binningMeasure β n M_Y)` is bounded by

`exp(n · (H(X, Y) + ε)) / (M_X · M_Y)`

— the joint typical set's cardinality bound divided by the product bin count.

Strategy: 3-product Tonelli swap on `BP := B_X × B_Y` and ambient `μ`,
followed by a per-`ω` slice bound via `binning_pair_alias_expectation_le_aux`
applied to `S := JTS.toFinite.toFinset` (which is `ω`-independent), and
closing with `jointlyTypicalSet_card_le`. -/

Assembles Phase D (decomposition), Phase E (per-term bounds), F.1 (total binning
expectation), F.2 (pigeonhole), and E.5 (exponential squeeze) into the achievability
of the full Slepian–Wolf rate region: for any rates strictly above the conditional
entropies `H(X|Y)`, `H(Y|X)` and the joint entropy `H(X,Y)`, there is a sequence of
binning encoders + joint typicality decoders whose error probability tends to `0`. -/

/-- **F.3 main theorem — Slepian–Wolf full rate region achievability**
(Cover–Thomas 15.4.1). For an i.i.d. source `(Xⁿ, Yⁿ)` with full support, any rate
pair `(R_X, R_Y)` with `R_X > H(X|Y)`, `R_Y > H(Y|X)`, `R_X + R_Y > H(X,Y)` is
achievable: there are codebook sizes `M_X, M_Y` with the required asymptotic rates and
encoders/decoders whose error probability → 0. -/

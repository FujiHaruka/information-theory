# Wyner–Ziv decoder-failure assembly: covering (AEP) + packing (S/M) at aligned μ/ε₀
# (T3-D wave10 S14)

This file **assembles the two halves** of the Wyner–Ziv random-binning
achievability argument into the combined decoder-failure → 0 bound, at a single
aligned joint-typicality predicate `JT = wzAEPCoveringJT μ Xs Ys ε₀`:

* the **covering** half (`ε₁`, AEP joint-typicality failure), discharged in
  `WynerZivCoveringTypicalityBody.lean` via `isCoveringTypicalityHyp_of_aep` and
  consumed by `wzCovering_decoder_fail_aep`;
* the **packing** half (`S/M`, random-binning collision / first-moment method),
  discharged in `WynerZivPackingBody.lean` via `wzPacking_isPacking_of_typicality`.

The covering body left the packing side as an **abstract input**
(`IsPackingExistenceHyp`, in `WynerZivCoveringBody.lean`). This file
**discharges that abstraction** from the genuine packing primitives — slice
cardinality bound `IsPackingTypicalityHyp`, per-hash `E_bin` measurability, and
the `S/M → 0` asymptotics — and then feeds the result into
`wzCovering_decoder_fail_aep`, so the end-to-end decoder-failure → 0 statement
no longer carries an opaque packing hypothesis: its only packing input is the
strictly-more-primitive (genuine, non-`True`) slice-cardinality predicate plus
its quantitative asymptotics.

## Approach

Two layers.

1. **`isPackingExistenceHyp_of_packing_data`** — the genuine discharge of
   `IsPackingExistenceHyp`. For each tolerance `ε > 0`, the `S/M → 0` asymptotic
   supplies `N` beyond which `S n · (M n)⁻¹ ≤ ε`; then for *any* covering pair
   `(Us, Ys)` the first-moment method `wzPacking_isPacking_of_typicality`
   extracts a good hash `f_U` with `IsWynerZivBinningPacking 0 (S n · (M n)⁻¹)`.
   Measurability of `E_bin` (= `IsPackingCollisionBoundHyp`) and of the decoder
   failure set are threaded as the standard finite-`Ω` hypotheses. This is the
   union-bound + collision-probability content, *not* a no-op.
2. **`wzDecoderFail_aep_assembled`** — feed the discharged packing into
   `wzCovering_decoder_fail_aep` at the SAME `μ`/`ε₀` (the covering JT predicate
   `wzAEPCoveringJT μ Xs Ys ε₀` is `μ`-dependent, so both halves must be
   instantiated at identical `μ`, `Xs`, `Ys`, `ε₀`). The result: from the i.i.d.
   random-codebook hypotheses (covering provenance) plus the slice-cardinality
   bound and `S/M → 0` (packing provenance), the WZ decoder failure probability
   tends to `0`.

## 撤退ライン

* **Slice cardinality `IsPackingTypicalityHyp` and the `S/M → 0` asymptotic are
  taken as inputs.** They are the genuine packing-side provenance (the concrete
  `S = exp(n(H(U|Y)+2ε))`, `M = exp(n R₂)`, with `R₂ > I(Y;U)` driving
  `S/M → 0`); their *quantitative* discharge lives in a separate typical-slice /
  rate seed. Here they are threaded exactly as `WynerZivPackingBody`'s
  `wyner_ziv_packing_existence` demands — this *is* the assembly, not a stub.
* **Per-`f_U` `E_bin` and decoder-failure measurability** are taken as input
  (automatic in the concrete finite-`Ω` / decidable-`JT` instantiation; carried
  abstractly to keep the body alphabet-agnostic), matching the hypotheses of the
  covering and packing bodies verbatim.

/-! ## Section 1 — Discharge of the abstract packing existence hypothesis

`WynerZivCoveringBody.IsPackingExistenceHyp` is the opaque packing input that the
covering body's `wzCovering_decoder_fail_existence` (hence `wzCovering_decoder_fail_aep`)
consumes. Here we *produce* it from the genuine packing primitives via the
first-moment method `wzPacking_isPacking_of_typicality`.

/-- **Discharge of `IsPackingExistenceHyp` from the packing primitives.**

From a per-block bin count `M n` (nonzero), slice cardinality bound `S n ≥ 0`
with `IsPackingTypicalityHyp (S n) (JT n)`, the per-hash `E_bin` and
decoder-failure measurability data, a reconstruction `f`, and the genuine
`S/M → 0` asymptotic, the abstract packing existence hypothesis
`IsPackingExistenceHyp μ JT` holds.

The body is the first-moment method: for any covering pair `(Us, Ys)`,
`wzPacking_isPacking_of_typicality` produces a good hash `f_U` with
`IsWynerZivBinningPacking 0 (S n · (M n)⁻¹)`, and `S n · (M n)⁻¹ ≤ ε` by the
asymptotic. This is the genuine union-bound + collision content, not a no-op. -/

/-- **Wyner–Ziv decoder failure → 0 — covering (AEP) + packing (S/M) assembled.**

The combined decoder-failure bound, with BOTH halves instantiated at the same
`μ`-dependent joint-typicality predicate `wzAEPCoveringJT μ Xs Ys ε₀`:

* **covering** (`ε₁`) is discharged by the AEP joint-typicality bound
  (`isCoveringTypicalityHyp_of_aep`) from the i.i.d. random-codebook hypotheses;
* **packing** (`S/M`) is discharged by the first-moment method
  (`isPackingExistenceHyp_of_packing_data`) from the slice-cardinality bound and
  the `S/M → 0` asymptotic.

The conclusion is `wzCovering_decoder_fail_aep`'s decoder-failure → 0, but with
its external packing hypothesis `IsPackingExistenceHyp` *eliminated* in favour of
the strictly-more-primitive packing primitives. -/

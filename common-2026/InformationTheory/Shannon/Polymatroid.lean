# Polymatroid axioms for joint entropy

`jointEntropySubset` (from `HanD.lean`) satisfies the three polymatroid rank
function axioms:

* `jointEntropySubset_empty` — `H(X_∅) = 0`.
* `jointEntropySubset_mono` — `S ⊆ T ⟹ H(X_S) ≤ H(X_T)`.
* `jointEntropySubset_submodular` — `H(X_{S∪T}) + H(X_{S∩T}) ≤ H(X_S) + H(X_T)`.

## Main statements

* `jointEntropySubset_empty`, `jointEntropySubset_mono`,
  `jointEntropySubset_submodular` — the three polymatroid axioms.
* `entropyPolymatroid` — joint entropy as a `Combinatorics.Polymatroid` term.

## Implementation notes

Monotonicity uses `MeasurableEquiv.piFinsetUnion` to reshape `T = S ⊔ (T\S)` as
a pair, then applies the pair chain rule and `condEntropy ≥ 0`. Submodularity uses
the three-piece disjoint decomposition `S ∪ T = I ⊔ A ⊔ B` (`I := S∩T`, `A := S\T`,
`B := T\S`) and `condEntropy_le_condEntropy_of_pair`.
